<p>WEBSTER was much possessed by death
 And saw the skull beneath the skin;
 And breastless creatures under ground
 Leaned backward with a lipless grin.
Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
 Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
 He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
 Tightening its lusts and luxuries.
Donne, I suppose, was such another
 Who found no substitute for sense,
 To seize and clutch and penetrate;
 Expert beyond experience,
He knew the anguish of the marrow
 The ague of the skeleton;
 No contact possible to flesh
 Allayed the fever of the bone.
Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye Is underlined for emphasis;
 Uncorseted, her friendly bust
 Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.
The couched Brazilian jaguar
 Compels the scampering marmoset
 With subtle effluence of cat;
 Grishkin has a maisonette;
The sleek Brazilian jaguar
 Does not in its arboreal gloom
 Distil so rank a feline smell
 As Grishkin in a drawing-room.
And even the Abstract Entities
 Circumambulate her charm;
 But our lot crawls between dry ribs
 To keep our metaphysics warm.
