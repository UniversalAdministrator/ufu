<p>APART, immutable, unseen, 
  Being, before itself had been, Became. 
Like dew a triple queen 
  Shone as the void uncovered: 
The silence of deep height was drawn
A veil across the silver dawn 
  On holy wings that hovered.  
The music of three thoughts became 
The beauty, that is one white flame, 
The justice that surpasses shame,        
The victory, the splendour, 
The sacred fountain that is whirled 
From depths beyond that older world 
A new world to engender.  
The kingdom is extended. 
Night Dwells, and I contemplate the sight 
That is not seeing, but the light 
That secretly is kindled, 
Though oft-time its most holy fire 
Lacks oil, wheneâ€™er my own Desire        
  Before desire has dwindled. 
 I see the thin web binding me 
With thirteen cords of unity  
Toward the calm centre of the sea. 
  (O thou supernal mother! )        
The triple light my path divides 
To twain and fifty sudden sides   
  Each perfect as each other. 
 Now backwards, inwards still my mind 
Must track the intangible and blind,       
And seeking, shall securely find 
  Hidden in secret places 
Fresh feasts for every soul that strives, 
New life for many mystic lives, 
  And strange new forms and faces.        
 My mind still searches, and attains 
By many days and many pains 
To That which Is and Was and reigns 
  Shadowed in four and ten;  
And loses self in sacred lands,        
And cries and quickens, and understands 
  Beyond the first Amen.
