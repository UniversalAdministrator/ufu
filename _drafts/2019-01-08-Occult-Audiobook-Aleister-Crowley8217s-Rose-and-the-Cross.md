<p>Out of the seething cauldron of my woes,
Where sweets and salt and bitterness I flung; 
Where charmed music gathered from my tongue,
And where I chained strange archipelagoes
Of fallen stars; where fiery passion flows 
A curious bitumen; where among
The glowing medley moved the tune unsung
Of perfect love: thence grew the Mystic Rose. 
Its myriad petals of divided light; 
Its leaves of the most radiant emerald; 
Its heart of fire like rubies. At the sight
I lifted up my heart to God and called:
How shall I pluck this dream of my desire? 
And lo! there shaped itself the Cross of Fire!
