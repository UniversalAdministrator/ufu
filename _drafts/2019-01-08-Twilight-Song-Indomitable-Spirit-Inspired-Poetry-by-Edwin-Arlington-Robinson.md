<p>Through the shine, through the rain 
We have shared the day’s load; 
To the old march again 
We have tramped the long road; 
We have laughed, we have cried, 
And we’ve tossed the King’s crown; 
We have fought, we have died, 
And we’ve trod the day down. 
So it’s lift the old song 
Ere the night flies again, 
Where the road leads along 
Through the shine, through the rain. 
Long ago, far away, 
Came a sign from the skies; 
And we feared then to pray 
For the new sun to rise: 
With the King there at hand, 
Not a child stepped or stirred— 
Where the light filled the land 
And the light brought the word; 
For we knew then the gleam 
Though we feared then the day, 
And the dawn smote the dream 
Long ago, far away. 
But the road leads us all, 
For the King now is dead; 
And we know, stand or fall, 
We have shared the day’s bread. 
We may laugh down the dream, 
For the dream breaks and flies; 
And we trust now the gleam, 
For the gleam never dies;— 
So it’s off now the load, 
For we know the night’s call, 
And we know now the road 
And the road leads us all. 
Through the shine, through the rain, 
We have wrought the day’s quest; 
To the old march again 
We have earned the day’s rest; 
We have laughed, we have cried, 
And we’ve heard the King’s groans; 
We have fought, we have died, 
And we’ve burned the King’s bones, 
And we lift the old song 
Ere the night flies again, 
Where the road leads along 
Through the shine, through the rain.
