<p>I WARN, like the one drop of rain
On your face, ere the storm;
Or tremble in whispered refrain
  With your blood, beating warm.
I am the presence that ever
Baffles your touch’s endeavor,—
Gone like the glimmer of dust
  Dispersed by a gust.
I am the absence that taunts you,
The fancy that haunts you;
The ever unsatisfied guess
That, questioning emptiness,
Wins a sigh for reply.
  Nay, nothing am I,
But the flight of a breath—
  For I am Death!
