<p>For me, for me, two horses wait, 
Two horses stand before my gate: 
Their vast black plumes on high are cast, 
Their black manes swing in the midnight blast, 
Red sparkles from their eyes fly fast. 
But can they drag the hearse behind, 
Whose black plumes mystify the wind? 
What a thing for this heap of bones and hair! 
Despair, despair! 
Yet think of half the world's winged shapes 
Which have come to thee wondering: 
At thee the terrible idiot gapes, 
At thee the running devil japes, 
And angels stoop to thee and sing 
From the soft midnight that enwraps 
Their limbs, so gently, sadly fair;-- 
Thou seest the stars shine through their hair. 
The blast again, ho, ho, the blast! 
I go to a mansion that shall outlast; 
And the stoled priest who steps before 
Shall turn and welcome me at the door.
