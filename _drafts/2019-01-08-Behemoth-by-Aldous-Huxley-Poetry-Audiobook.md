<p>His eyes are little rutilant stones 
sunk in black basalt; scale by scale, 
men count the wealth of silver mail
that laps his flesh and iron bones.
And from his navel, deep and wide
as an old Cyclops' drinking-bowl,
spring those stout nerves of twisted hide
that are his life and strength and soul.
Basking his belly, fast asleep,
he sprawls on the warm shingle bank;
And the bold Ethiops come and creep
along his polished heaving flank,
and in his navel brew their wine
and drink vast strength and grow divine.
