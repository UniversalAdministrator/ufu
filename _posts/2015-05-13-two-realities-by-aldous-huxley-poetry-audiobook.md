post_excerpt: |
  A wagon passed with scarlet wheels
  And a yellow body, shining new.
  “Splendid!” said I. “How fine it feels
  To be alive, when beauty peels
  The grimy husk from life.” And you
  Said, “Splendid!” and I thought you’d seen
  That wagon blazing down the street;
  But I looked and saw your gaze had been
  On a child that was kicking an obscene
  Brown ordure with his feet.
  Our souls are elephants, thought I,
  Remote behind a prisoning grill,
  With trunks thrust out to peer and pry
  And pounce upon reality;
  And each at his own secret will
  Seizes the buns he likes best
  And passes over all the rest.
