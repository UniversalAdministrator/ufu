post_excerpt: |
  WEBSTER was much possessed by death
  And saw the skull beneath the skin;
  And breastless creatures under ground
  Leaned backward with a lipless grin.
  Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
  Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
  He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
  Tightening its lusts and luxuries.
  Donne, I suppose, was such another
  Who found no substitute for sense,
  To seize and clutch and penetrate;
  Expert beyond experience,
  He knew the anguish of the marrow
  The ague of the skeleton;
  No contact possible to flesh
  Allayed the fever of the bone.
  Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye Is underlined for emphasis;
  Uncorseted, her friendly bust
  Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.
  The couched Brazilian jaguar
  Compels the scampering marmoset
  With subtle effluence of cat;
  Grishkin has a maisonette;
  The sleek Brazilian jaguar
  Does not in its arboreal gloom
  Distil so rank a feline smell
  As Grishkin in a drawing-room.
  And even the Abstract Entities
  Circumambulate her charm;
  But our lot crawls between dry ribs
  To keep our metaphysics warm.
