post_title: '[Analysis of Body and Soul and their Interaction] The Soul (by Emanuel Swedenborg) Part 2'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  This is a thorough analysis of the body and the soul and their interaction written by Emanuel Swedenborg who was famous for his astral journey into the other worlds. The first part of this book is mainly focused on the body and then the analysis of the soul and their interaction follows. This is a scholarly book and not a easy listen but for those who are interested in the occult anatomy of the human's body and soul, this is a great listen.
