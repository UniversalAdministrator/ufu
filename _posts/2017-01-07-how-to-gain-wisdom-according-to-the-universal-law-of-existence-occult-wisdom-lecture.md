author: UfU
post_excerpt: >
  The lecturer Manly P. Hall was a master
  in all the aspects of mental/spiritual
  development. It is so easy to be
  ignorant and self-righteous believing
  that you know it all as we grow old. But
  attaining spiritual wisdom takes much
  more than passively growing old. Wisdom
  and spiritual maturity could be some
  grand illusions for many of us. The
  master occult scholar Manly P. Hall
  shares his insight on how to become wise
  as years pass by.
