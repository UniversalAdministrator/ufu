post_excerpt: |
  This is a soliloquy of the mythological character Tithonus, who attained immortality yet forgot to ask to stay young. The result? Please hear what he has to say about his immortality and its devastating consequence. The narrator Leonard Wilson did an amazing job which drags the audience into the abyss of agonizing mental hell of the protagonist Tithonus. The moral of the story is, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR!
