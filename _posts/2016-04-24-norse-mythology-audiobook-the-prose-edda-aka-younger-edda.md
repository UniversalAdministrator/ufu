  If you want to skip 'Christian-influence', click 12:34 mark to start from the main text since the translator did a poor job on 'Prologue' part (for example, translating 'Ask and Embla' (Norse male/female arch-types) to 'Adam and Eve' to please Christian readers). But despite of not-so-great translation (especially 'prologue' part), this is the most valuable source of Norse mythology - cosmology along with the Elder Edda and a must read for the fans of Norse mythology or J. R. R. Tolkien and other fantasy writers.
