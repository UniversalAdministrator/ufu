  As It Was in the Beginning (Poetry
  Audiobook) by George Sterling
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  The royal word goes forth, and armies do
  The work of devils. Agony and waste
  Are on the world, and the grim legions haste
  On the old war-roads that the Caesars knew.
  Still gleams the dreadful stain of Waterloo,
  On Time's accusing record unerased;
  Gone are the ramparts that the Romans faced,
  But these the heavens where their eagles flew.
  Below the bleak and slowly shifting stars,
  Man turns him in his madness, to reveal
  His ancient folly and his ancient crime,
  And on the tragic breast austere with scars
  Re-girds the mail, and draws the hiked steel,
  Cold from the twilight battlefields of Time.
