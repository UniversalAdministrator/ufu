hello YouTube it&#39;s Sam Ridgeway with<br>live like a Viking common today I am<br>extremely happy why is that because one<br>we just passed 4000 subscribers so a big<br>shout-out to everybody subscribed and<br>everyone that supports the channel I<br>sincerely appreciate your support - its<br>carb day I only get carbs every fourth<br>day today happens to be that day I might<br>be a little sweating for all you haters<br>out there it is not because I&#39;m about to<br>die okay it&#39;s because I eat 18 eggs a<br>day 9 in the morning and 9 at night and<br>with those eggs I put in jalapenos<br>copious amounts of Tabasco<br>I put as hot a sauce on top that I<br>possibly can and when I&#39;m finished with<br>that 9 egg omelette I am sweating so I<br>am I think a Mexican Viking so let&#39;s<br>just put that out there now you&#39;re here<br>because of some I&#39;m telling you today<br>you are gonna be absolutely amazed so I<br>know you&#39;re gonna want to you&#39;re gonna<br>stay with me and at the end of this<br>you&#39;re probably gonna want to call me<br>Paul say de Leon because I am bringing<br>you the Fountain of Youth so let&#39;s get<br>you it now normally I don&#39;t read shit I<br>just like I memorize it and I tell you<br>what it is right but today there&#39;s so<br>much information that I feel like I have<br>to read it real little and I have to put<br>on the old man glasses or else I can&#39;t<br>see shit alright and that&#39;s the way that<br>we are so what we&#39;re talking about today<br>is at the Talon okay<br>epic Talon the this is just stay with me<br>now what is it normally I don&#39;t really<br>go into the scientific stuff because<br>nobody really gives a shit but today I<br>think that it&#39;s important to give kind<br>of a backlog on what this is so it&#39;s a<br>synthetic version of the polypeptide<br>epithalamus<br>which is produced normally by our body<br>so we normally produce this in very<br>small quantities it was discovered in<br>the late 1980s by a Russian scientist<br>named Vladimir cabin s&#39;en ok and one of<br>the things it does is regulates the<br>metabolism of the pineal gland<br>now the pineal glands often referred to<br>as the third eye because it was<br>mysteriously thought of as the part of<br>the brain that connects the<br>chuckle world to the spiritual world<br>alright but now all that voodoo talk<br>aside the pineal gland controls a very<br>the various bio rhythms of the body and<br>works with the hypothalamus gland okay<br>which directs the body&#39;s thirst hunger<br>sexual desire and this is the important<br>part the biological clock that<br>determines our aging process okay so if<br>I&#39;m claiming that this is the Fountain<br>of Youth that must mean things have<br>lived longer correct yes let&#39;s go<br>through the trials so why can it make us<br>live longer first of all in the animal<br>trials the initial tests of epital and<br>made fruit flies live 11 to 16 percent<br>longer obviously that&#39;s at the very<br>beginning we&#39;re just doing to do in<br>fruit flies all right then mice lived 24<br>percent longer it improved immunity to<br>diseases in rats and then it produced<br>anti carcinogenic effects so basically<br>it prevents cancer it stimulates<br>antioxidant defenses which of course<br>that eradicate free radicals and the<br>shit that gets us sick and it restored<br>reproductive function in old rats so old<br>rats apparently became dirty young rats<br>alright that&#39;s good now okay fine rats<br>mice fruit flies what&#39;s that got to do<br>with me well let&#39;s keep going so in<br>humans it did everything that it did in<br>the animal trials and it increased the<br>length of our telomeres now why is that<br>important - because telomeres protect<br>the end of our chromosomes from sticking<br>together<br>they&#39;re like protective caps it&#39;s like<br>the little plastic thing on shoelaces it<br>keeps them from from degrading faster<br>and make sure that they don&#39;t stick<br>together so everything gets all jumbled<br>up okay and as cells carry out DNA<br>replication the chromosomes are<br>shortened they get smaller it&#39;s like<br>when you make a copy of a copy of a copy<br>that 10th copy is a pretty shitty copy<br>right because it&#39;s copy of a copy of<br>carbon copy okay that&#39;s important so<br>your telomeres get too short the cell<br>dies because if we can&#39;t replicate<br>anymore the copy is so bad that it<br>cannot replicate in the cell dies now<br>that effectively this effectively shows<br>how old your body really<br>is so that&#39;s the length of your telomers<br>show so there&#39;s like a service it&#39;s<br>called what the hell&#39;s it called telling<br>years and you can subscribe you know get<br>a kid in like like 23andme and that kind<br>of thing and it&#39;ll actually tell you how<br>long your telomeres are and how long the<br>telomeres are that&#39;s how old you really<br>are I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re thirty years<br>old your telomers say you&#39;re sixty your<br>ass is sixty okay<br>so um you can also help shorten the<br>length of your telomeres by doing stupid<br>shit like smoking getting fat you know<br>stuff that&#39;s bad for you so epic how it<br>actually increases the length of those<br>telomeres which in turn gives us many<br>more replications before they die which<br>effectively and absolutely makes us<br>younger okay so there was a 12-year<br>study in older people twelve years and<br>this was a human trial now not only did<br>epital on restore the cognitive<br>abilities of the elderly it regulated<br>their cholesterol and it improved their<br>immune system but allegedly according to<br>the study it gave them seven additional<br>years of healthier life they lived seven<br>more years than the people that didn&#39;t<br>take this the control group okay so I<br>mean seriously okay so there&#39;s a service<br>like I said called telomeres again like<br>23andme ancestry.com that sort of thing<br>but it tells you how old you are by<br>measuring the length of your telomers so<br>here&#39;s a guy that used a service for<br>tell years he set a sample in before he<br>started epital<br>and he got a sample again after eight<br>months of dosing up a talent okay so as<br>you can see I&#39;ll put up on the screen he<br>originally was 53 year old years old and<br>his telomers said he was 56 not a good<br>sign right<br>so eight months later after he took<br>three cycles of up a talent in which he<br>did ten milligrams a day for ten days<br>then he took one month off in between<br>then he did another test okay he was 54<br>years old at that point in time and his<br>telomers came back with the same teller<br>years came back<br>and said he was 37 now tell me that&#39;s<br>not remarkable okay so now many of you<br>know me and you know how I do stuff so<br>you know where my telly years packages<br>yes it is in transit to my house right<br>now<br>I will be doing the test I will be<br>sending it in and even though this is<br>research chemical and I do not recommend<br>that you do any of that shit I don&#39;t<br>know I&#39;m gonna see what it does okay<br>that&#39;s just just me why because they&#39;re<br>even better there&#39;s no negative effects<br>to epital on nothing has been shown as a<br>negative with this thing nothing okay<br>so always do your research but this<br>compounds been around since the late<br>1980s it&#39;s shown numerous benefits and<br>animal trials and human trials<br>it&#39;s also it also has no known side<br>effects okay and while the human studies<br>showed epic talent increased life<br>expectancy it should be mentioned that<br>this control group stopped taking it now<br>nothing says you have to stop taking it<br>so the question is how long do you think<br>you could live if you continued to bring<br>epital on into your medicinal protocol<br>right okay so you know here&#39;s kind of<br>the weird thing - a lot of times I look<br>at these peptides and like this guy<br>dosed what 10 milligrams a day wouldn&#39;t<br>10 milligrams a day for for 10 days<br>right and and they sell them in like two<br>milligram vials in two milligram that&#39;s<br>how they come so you would need five<br>vials a day for 10 days you would need<br>50 vials now that&#39;s from like pure Oz I<br>mean who&#39;s gonna buy 50 vials that&#39;s<br>just crazy<br>now I have seen from other places where<br>you can get a hundred milligrams of epic<br>talent okay you know that makes more<br>sense right<br>so you just don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s fake<br>or not because there&#39;s so much fake shit<br>going around but anyway I want to hear<br>anybody have a problem with this one and<br>that&#39;s about it now you know questions<br>comments suggestions put them below and<br>remember you are never too old to live<br>like a Viking until next time peace<br>[Music]<br>you<br>
