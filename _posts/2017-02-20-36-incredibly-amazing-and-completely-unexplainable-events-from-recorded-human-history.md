They didn’t just randomly drift into them. Tests have been done showing how unlikely this is. They would have to possess complex knowledge of currents and what not.

<blockquote data-valid-location="true"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taman_Shud_Case" target="_blank">In 1948 a dead man was found on Somerton Beach, Australia, with the cause of death and identity of the man both being unknown.</a> What separates this case from other unidentified, unexplained deaths are the highly bizarre details in the case, leading many to assume that international espionage or other conspiracies might have been involved.

Despite being newly deceased, no one has been able to identify the man, who carried no identification or passport, only a pack of English cigarettes, Juicy Fruit gum, several unused train tickets, and most mysteriously a scrap of the last page of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyat -a collection of Persian Sufi poems and very rare book at the time- sewed into a hidden compartment in his pants. On this scrap the words “Taman Shud”, “it is finished” in Persian, were wrote. As the only clue, police issued a search for all copies of the Rubiayat, looking for a copy missing the final page.

An tip came forward that a private citizen living in Somerton had such a book. Upon examining the book, the investigators noted that not only was the final page missing, but a jumble of letters was written on the inside back cover. Tests showed the paper found on the body matched the book, and police assumed the writing was some kind of code. According to the man, who remained anonymous, several weeks before the body was found he had left a copy of the Rubaiyet in his car, unlocked. Cryptologists have been unable to break the code.

The autopsy revealed absolutely nothing, aside from the fact that the man had eaten shortly before his death. No apparent cause of death lead authorities to assume poisoning, yet toxicological reports found no identifiable poisons in the body, and the cause of death remains a mystery.

And finally, during the course of the investigation authorities discovered an eerily similar case had occurred 3 years earlier in which a Singaporean man by the name George Marshall was found dead in Sydney. No cause of death could be determined- and a copy of the Rubaiyat was found on his body.</blockquote>
