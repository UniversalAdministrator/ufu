  White Death (For H. P. Lovecraft Fans)
  by Clark Ashton Smith (Poetry )
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Methought the world was bound with final frost;
  The sun, made hueless as with fear and awe,
  Illumined yet the lands it could not thaw.
  Then on my road, with instant evening crost,
  Death stood, and in its shadowy films enwound,
  Mine eyes forgot the light, until I came
  Where poured the inseparate, unshadowed flame
  Of phantom suns in self-irradiance drowned.
  Death lay revealed in all its haggardness—
  Immitigable wastes horizonless;
  Profundities that held nor bar nor veil;
  All hues wherewith the suns and worlds were dyed
  In light invariable nullified;
  All darkness rendered shelterless and pale.
  ---- End ----

<p>Methought the world was bound with final frost;
The sun, made hueless as with fear and awe,
Illumined yet the lands it could not thaw.
Then on my road, with instant evening crost,
Death stood, and in its shadowy films enwound,
Mine eyes forgot the light, until I came
Where poured the inseparate, unshadowed flame
Of phantom suns in self-irradiance drowned.
Death lay revealed in all its haggardness—
Immitigable wastes horizonless;
Profundities that held nor bar nor veil;
All hues wherewith the suns and worlds were dyed
In light invariable nullified;
All darkness rendered shelterless and pale.
