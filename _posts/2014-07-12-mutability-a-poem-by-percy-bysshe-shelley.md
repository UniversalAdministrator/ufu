  Mutability, a Poem by Percy Bysshe
  Shelley,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;
  How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,
  Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon
  Night closes round, and they are lost forever:
  
  Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
  Give various response to each varying blast,
  To whose frail frame no second motion brings
  One mood or modulation like the last.
  
  We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;
  We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day;
  We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
  Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:
  
  It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
  The path of its departure still is free:
  Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
  Nought may endure but mutability!
  --------End of version 1------
  The flower that smiles to-day
  To-morrow dies;
  All that we wish to stay
  Tempts and then flies.
  What is this world's delight?
  Lightning that mocks the night,
  Brief even as bright.
  
  Virtue, how frail it is!
  Friendship how rare!
  Love, how it sells poor bliss
  For proud despair!
  But we, though soon they fall,
  Survive their joy, and all
  Which ours we call.
  
  Whilst skies are blue and bright,
  Whilst flowers are gay,
  Whilst eyes that change ere night
  Make glad the day;
  Whilst yet the calm hours creep,
  Dream thou—and from thy sleep
  Then wake to weep.

How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon
Night closes round, and they are lost forever:

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
One mood or modulation like the last.

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;
We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:

The path of its departure still is free:
