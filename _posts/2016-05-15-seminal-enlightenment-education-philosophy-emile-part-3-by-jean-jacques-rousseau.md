<p>Rousseau played a seminal role for the Enlightenment movement in Europe but he had to suffer some hardships in his time including having this book (Emile) publicly burned in 1762 and arrest warrant being issued on him since he refused the concept of original sin and divine revelation. This book is a seminal classic on the subjects of education and the nature of man and greatly influenced the Enlightenment movement.
