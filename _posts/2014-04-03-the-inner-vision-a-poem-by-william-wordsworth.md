  The Inner Vision, a Poem by William
  Wordsworth,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  MOST sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
  To pace the ground, if path there be or none
  While a fair region round the Traveller lies
  Which he forbears again to look upon;
  Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene
  The work of Fancy, or some happy tone
  Of meditation, slipping in between
  The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
  —If Thought and Love desert us, from that day
  Let us break off all commerce with the Muse:
  With Thought and Love companions of our way—
  Whate'er the senses take or may refuse,—
  The Mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
  Of inspiration on the humblest lay.
  -End-
