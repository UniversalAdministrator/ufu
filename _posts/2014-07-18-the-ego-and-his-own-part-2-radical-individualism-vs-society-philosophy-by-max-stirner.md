<p>The author is the one in the thumbnail picture. The picture on the video is Rudolf Steiner, not Max Stirner. Sorry for the mistake!
In this book, his most famous, Max Stirner presents a philosophical case for a radical egoism that shuns the socially-oriented outlooks of both "establishment" ideologies and of revolutionaries in favor of an extreme individualism. (Summary by Mat Messerschmidt)
