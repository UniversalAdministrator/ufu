  The Ghost Pirates (For H. P. Lovecraft
  Fans), A Tale of the Curse by the
  Sea-Devils, Horror
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Being a huge fan of horror fictions of Hodgson, Lovecraft praised this book as, I quote, "The Ghost Pirates . . . is a powerful account of a doomed and haunted ship on its last voyage, and of the terrible sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps the spirits of bygone buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to an unknown fate. With its command of maritime knowledge, and its clever selection of hints and incidents suggestive of latent horrors in nature, this book at times reaches enviable peaks of power." Listen to the book and see for yourself!
