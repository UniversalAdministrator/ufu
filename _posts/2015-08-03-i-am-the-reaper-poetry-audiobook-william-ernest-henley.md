  I Am The Reaper (Poetry Audiobook)
  William Ernest Henley
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  I am the Reaper.
  All things with heedful hook
  Silent I gather.
  Pale roses touched with the spring,
  Tall corn in summer,
  Fruits rich with autumn, and frail winter blossoms—
  Reaping, still reaping—
  All things with heedful hook
  Timely I gather.
  I am the Sower.
  All the unbodied life
  Runs through my seed-sheet.
  Atom with atom wed,
  Each quickening the other,
  Fall through my hands, ever changing, still changeless.
  Ceaselessly sowing,
  Life, incorruptible life,
  Flows from my seed-sheet.
  Maker and breaker,
  I am the ebb and the flood,
  Here and Hereafter,
  Sped through the tangle and coil
  Of infinite nature,
  Viewless and soundless I fashion all being.
  Taker and giver,
  I am the womb and the grave,
  The Now and the Ever
  --------  End  ---------
