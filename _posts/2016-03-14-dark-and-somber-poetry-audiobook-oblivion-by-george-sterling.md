<p>Her eyes have seen the monoliths of kings
    Upcast like foam of the effacing tide;
    She hath beheld the desert stars deride
The monuments of Power's imaginingsâ€”
About their base the wind Assyrian flings
    The dust that throned the satrap in his pride;
    Cambyses and the Memphian pomps abide
As in the flame the moth's presumptuous wings.
There gleams no glory that her hand shall spare,
    Nor any sun whose rays shall cross her night,
        Whose realm enfolds man's empire and its end.
No armor of renown her sword shall dare,
    No council of the gods withstand her might:
        Stricken at last Time's lonely Titans bend.
