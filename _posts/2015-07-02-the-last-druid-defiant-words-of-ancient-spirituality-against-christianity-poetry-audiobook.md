  The Last Druid (Defiant Words of Ancient
  Spirituality Against Christianity)

post_excerpt: |
  DESPAIRING and alone,
  Where mountain winds make moan,
  My days are spent:
  Each sacred wood and cave
  Is a forgotten grave
  Where none lament.
  This is my native sod,
  But to a stranger God
  My people pray;
  Till to myself I seem
  A scarce remembered dream
  When morn is gray.
  I know not what I seek;
  My heart is cold and weak,
  My eyes are dim:
  Across the vale I hear
  An anthem glad and clear,
  The Christians' hymn.
  Oh, Christ, to whom they sing,
  Thou art not yet the King
  Of this wild spot;
  I am too weary now
  At new−made shrines to bow;
  I know Thee not.
  They say, when death is o'er
  Man lives for evermore
  In heaven or hell;
  They call Thee Love and Light:
  Alas! they may be right,
  I cannot tell.
  But if in truth Thou live,
  If to mankind Thou give
  Life, motion, breath;
  If Love and Light Thou be,
  No longer torture me,
  But grant me death.
  Give me not heaven, but rest;
  In earth's all−sheltering breast
  Hide me from scorn:
  The gods I served are slain;
  My life is lived in vain;
  Why was I born?
  Gone is the ancient race;
  Earth has not any place
  For such as I:
  Nothing is true but grief;
  I have outlived belief,
  Then let me die.
  These dim, deserted skies
  To aged heart and eyes
  No comfort give:
  Woe to my hoary head!
  Woe! for the gods are dead,
  And yet I live.
  --------  End --------
