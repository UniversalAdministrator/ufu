  What the Moon Brings, by H. P.
  Lovecraft, Audiobook
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  I just uploaded a playlist of 'the Entire Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft in Sequential Order (  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG8klsjxFY-NUysXKqNWeu2OkmOZGj7vD  ).' This is the ONLY playlist on the internet that covers THE ENTIRE DREAM CYCLE in their sequential order. Listening to them in a proper sequence will give you an in-depth satisfaction of submerging into the world of Lovecraft. Enjoy! (The playlist will be showing on my Youtube page in a few minutes so if you cannot see the playlist at the moment, come back to my channel a little bit later.) And this wonderful recording of "What the Moon Brings" is the creation of Colin Timothy Gagnon. Please visit his following website for more information which is www.SacredPotato.com and this recording is posted under the creative commons license 3.0.
