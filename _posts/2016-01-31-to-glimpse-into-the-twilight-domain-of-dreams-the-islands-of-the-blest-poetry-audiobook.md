post_excerpt: |
  In Carmel pines the summer wind
  Sings like a distant sea.
  O harps of green, your murmurs find
  An ecnoing chord in me!
  On Carmel shore the breakers moan
  Like pines that breast a gale.
  O whence, ye winds and billows, flown
  To cry your wordless tale?
  Perchance the crimson sunsets drown
  In waters whence ye sped;
  Perchance the sinking stars go down
  To seek the Isles ye fled.
  Sometimes from ocean dusks I seem
  To glimpse their crystal walls,
  Dim jewels of mirage that gleam
  In twilight's western halls.
  Sometimes I hear below the moon
  A music that pursues—
  A wraith of melody, that soon
  I doubt, and douhting, lose.
  Those palmy shores no prow may find,
  But once it seemed to me
  A ghost of fragrance roamed the wind.
  Yet was not of the sea.
  What tho' my tale the seaman scorns?
  The Chart of Dreams, unrolled,
  Attests their haven's jasper bourns,
  Their reefs of sunken gold.
  I do not know what lonely strands
  Await the wingéd star;
  I only know their evening sands
  Seem wonderful and far.
