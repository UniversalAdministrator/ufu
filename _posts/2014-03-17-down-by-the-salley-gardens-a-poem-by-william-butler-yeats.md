  Down by the Salley Gardens, a Poem by
  William Butler Yeats,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Down by the salley gardens
  my love and I did meet;
  She passed the salley gardens
  with little snow-white feet.
  She bid me take love easy,
  as the leaves grow on the tree;
  But I, being young and foolish,
  with her would not agree.
  In a field by the river
  my love and I did stand,
  And on my leaning shoulder
  she laid her snow-white hand.
  She bid me take life easy,
  as the grass grows on the weirs;
  But I was young and foolish,
  and now am full of tears.
  -End-
