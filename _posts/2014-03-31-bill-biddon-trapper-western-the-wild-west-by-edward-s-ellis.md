<p>Our young hero and his companion plan to make their fortunes in the California gold rush. Having made their way to Missouri, they join a wagon train headed for the famed Oregon Trail, but being carefree and adventuresome young men, they are not happy relaxing by the fireside of an evening. Encounters with animals, raging rivers and "Injuns" keep them interested in their voyage, but what will the Pacific Coast hold for them? - Summary by Lynne Thompson
