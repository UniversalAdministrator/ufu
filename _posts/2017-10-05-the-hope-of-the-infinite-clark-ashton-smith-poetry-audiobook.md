  The Hope of the Infinite (Clark Ashton
  Smith) Poetry Audiobook
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  My hope is in the unharvestable deep
  That shows with eve the treasure of the stars
  To mournful kings behind their palace-bars,
  And wanderers outworn, and boys who weep
  A shattered bauble — or above the sleep
  Of headsmen, and of men condemned to die,
  Pours out the moon's white mercy from on high,
  Or hides with clement gloom the hours that creep
  Like death-worms to the grave. . . . And I have ta'en
  From storming seas by sunset glorified,
  Or from the dawn of ashen wastes and wide,
  Some light re-gathered from the lamps that wane,
  And promise of a translunary Spain
  Where loves forgone and forfeit dreams abide.
