post_excerpt: |
  NOONDAY upon the Alpine meadows
  Pours its avalanche of Light
  And blazing flowers: the very shadows
  Translucent are and bright.
  It seems a glory that nought surpasses—
  Passion of angels in form and hue—
  When, lo! from the jewelled heaven of the grasses
  Leaps a lightning of sudden blue.
  Dimming the sun-drunk petals,
  Bright even unto pain,
  The grasshopper flashes, settles,
  And then is quenched again.

<p>NOONDAY upon the Alpine meadows
Pours its avalanche of Light
And blazing flowers: the very shadows
Translucent are and bright.
It seems a glory that nought surpasses—
Passion of angels in form and hue—
When, lo! from the jewelled heaven of the grasses
Leaps a lightning of sudden blue.
Dimming the sun-drunk petals,
Bright even unto pain,
The grasshopper flashes, settles,
And then is quenched again.
