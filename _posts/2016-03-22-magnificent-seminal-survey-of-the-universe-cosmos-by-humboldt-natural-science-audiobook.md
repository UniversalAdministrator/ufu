<p>The main text starts at 22:25 mark. This is one of the VERY BEST books in the genre of natural science. The book is “a portrait of nature”, describing the physical nature of outer space and the earth. The author Humboldt was an influential proponent of romantic philosophy and a well known geographer, naturalist and explorer in his days. This book offers a very unique perspective on the subject from the view point of a seasoned naturalist/explorer/scientist and romantic thinker.
