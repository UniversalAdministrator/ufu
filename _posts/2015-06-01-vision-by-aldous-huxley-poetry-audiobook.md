post_excerpt: |
  I had been sitting alone with books,
  Till doubt was a black disease,
  When I heard the cheerful shout of rooks
  In the bare, prophetic trees.
  Bare trees, prophetic of new birth,
  You lift your branches clean and free
  To be a beacon to the earth,
  A flame of wrath for all to see.
  And the rooks in the branches laugh and shout
  To those that can hear and understand;
  "Walk through the gloomy ways of doubt
  With the torch of vision in your hand."
