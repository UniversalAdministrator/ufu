post_excerpt: |
  There's a church by a lake in Italy
  Stands white on a hill against the sky?
  And a path of immemorial cobbles
  Leads up and up, where the pilgrim hobbles
  Past a score or so of neat reposories,
  Where you stop and breathe and tell your rosaries
  To the shrined terra-cotta mannikins,
  That expound with the liveliest quirks and grins
  Known texts of Scripture. But no long stay
  Should the pilgrim make upon his way;
  But as means to the end these shrines stand here
  To guide to something holier,
  The church on the hilltop.
  Your heaven's so,
  With a path leading up to it past a row
  Of votary Priapulids;
  At each you pause and tell your beads
  Along the quintuple strings of sense:
  Then on, to face Heaven's eminence,
  New stimulated, new inspired.
  ----------- End -----------
