[Music]<br>you<br>[Music]<br>as the reader more and more can see we<br>are controlled by karma and by making us<br>believe that everything is karmic the<br>alien force has an easier time<br>controlling even the afterlife because<br>we humans are to a large degree<br>controlling it ourselves by creating a<br>rest place in which we spend time<br>pondering our previous life deciding<br>what we did right and what we did wrong<br>our emotional body still intact in the<br>afterlife has since long been<br>manipulated into believing that it&#39;s<br>necessary to come back to earth until<br>our karmic cycle is complete which is<br>unlikely that it ever will be because we<br>are creating new karmic acts as we go<br>along with our lives thereby we are<br>trapping ourselves unnecessarily while<br>the alien invader force is more or less<br>just sitting in the background watching<br>it all happened before their very eyes<br>patting each other&#39;s backs bragging<br>about how clever they are and how stupid<br>Humanity is there is more we need to<br>cover here in order for people to<br>understand what they are talking about<br>in regards to chakras and Kundalini it&#39;s<br>not that we shouldn&#39;t touch on these<br>subjects when we evolved as a species<br>but there is as always a fine line<br>between liberation and imprisonment if<br>we don&#39;t know this how can we possibly<br>liberate ourselves therefore let<br>continue and reveal some additional<br>imperative information this paper is<br>mainly about death in the afterlife but<br>I also want to extend it to<br>enlightenment and control of both life<br>and death in the bigger scheme it is all<br>connected and meant to keep us in check<br>regardless how clever we think we are<br>when we are trying to enlighten<br>ourselves and reach higher states of<br>consciousness a new age but even in many<br>teachings in general about alignment the<br>discussion is about the third eye<br>located inside our foreheads where the<br>pineal gland is this is also known as<br>the sixth chakra and we are under the<br>impression that we should use our third<br>eye to perceive things that are outside<br>our normal range of reality ie the third<br>dimension however we can also clearly<br>see that where the third eye is located<br>there are Cobras snakes and vultures<br>Birds coming out as can be seen in the<br>ancient Pharaoh&#39;s headdresses<br>what are the snakes into bird tribe<br>associated with and Kia and the alien<br>invader force isn&#39;t there something on<br>with that picture well we can say the<br>ancient Pharaoh&#39;s we re certainly<br>initiated in ancient secret societies<br>and they knew about the pineal gland and<br>the third eye it&#39;s as simple as that<br>nothing strange with it okay let&#39;s move<br>on and we will see if that is correct or<br>not the Nagas are known as the snake<br>people and many of them are also known<br>to live underground in the vicinity of<br>King Nergal and Queen RS cagoule they<br>are said to be the servants to the king<br>and the Queen as we&#39;ve discussed earlier<br>let&#39;s see if the Vedas have some<br>connection to Nergal and ers kegel they<br>do in fact more than one which can be<br>expected we have mentioned the<br>connection before such as caller being<br>equated to arrest giggle and kala to<br>Nergal other connections are kadru as<br>the mother of the Nagas and consort to<br>Kashyapa who we know is an avatar of<br>Vishnu Kandra would therefore easily be<br>associated with arrest giggle who then<br>is the king of the Nagas the snake<br>people after not too much effort we find<br>out that the king of the Nagas is one of<br>the primal beings of creation according<br>to some and according to bhagavad-gita<br>Rana the king is the avatar to the<br>supreme god known as narayana narayana<br>is also known as vishnu and Hari Ananda<br>is the celestial snake on which lurid<br>vision of reclines if we look up Ananta<br>this term means endless limitless or<br>eternal and infinite in other words we<br>find snakes and snake people being quite<br>common concepts in the Hindu religion<br>ultimately the snake horse Earp and is<br>associated with Lucifer in the Garden of<br>Eden of course<br>we also have a Trinity in the Vedas<br>exactly like we do in the Christian<br>religion and elsewhere in Hinduism it<br>takes form out of the term Trimurti the<br>Trimurti represents the cosmic functions<br>of creation maintenance and destruction<br>and is personified by Brahma the Creator<br>Vishnu the maintainer and Shiva the<br>destroyer or transformer this Trinity is<br>also called the hindu triad or the hindu<br>trinity all having the same meaning of<br>three and one furthermore the vedas tell<br>us that vishnu is also venerated as<br>Mukunda which means god who is the giver<br>of Mukti or moksha liberation from the<br>cycle of rebirths to his devotees or the<br>worthy ones who deserve salvation from<br>the material world this is telling us<br>that Lord Vishnu is the one responsible<br>for liberating us from the material<br>world in this case 3d here on earth the<br>prison planet but only for those who<br>were his devotees or for those are<br>worthy to deserve salvation from the<br>material world the rest of us are thrown<br>to the wolves literally and figuratively<br>speaking and get stuck in the recycling<br>dramas eons upon eons to come then if we<br>take this a little further we get to<br>this<br>quote aid in Hinduism bhakti also<br>spelled bhakti Sanskrit literally<br>meaning portion share from the root<br>Podge to partake in to receive one share<br>refers to religious devotion of a<br>devotee in the worship of the divine<br>within monotheistic Hinduism it is the<br>love felt by the worship her towards the<br>personal God a concept expressed in<br>Hindu theology as st david ah also asked<br>vayam bhagavan and gaudiya vaishnavism<br>finally let&#39;s look at civilian bhagavaan<br>is a sanskrit theological term for the<br>concept of absolute representation of<br>God as Bhagavad within Hinduism he is<br>the one eternal supreme being called<br>brahma vishnu shiva and srimurti<br>as we can see from the above quotes lord<br>vishnu is controlling everything<br>including enlightenment this is one<br>reason why I have a hard time accepting<br>the idea that we must wait before<br>evolving to the next levels of<br>consciousness until the rest of humanity<br>has come to the same level<br>doesn&#39;t that sound as something someone<br>would say who embraces vishnu x&#39; slash<br>Enki&#39;s manipulative system if the alien<br>invader force controlled enlightenment<br>wouldn&#39;t their greatest fear be that all<br>of humanity or at least the majority<br>would see how the trap is constructed<br>and managed to escape or take back what<br>is rightfully theirs then as an oxymoron<br>wouldn&#39;t the invaders want everybody to<br>wait for each other so that they could<br>continue controlling and defeating those<br>who were on their way to make it of<br>course they would they&#39;d rather see a<br>few people escape occasionally while<br>they dedicate time to setting up the<br>world they want the rest to live in if<br>we all waited for the rest to wake up no<br>one would escape the trap or be able to<br>take back what is theirs the way I see<br>it is that those who are awake should<br>educate as many as they can and then<br>move on in whatever direction they<br>please<br>to tell people to wait is a concept that<br>definitely comes from institutions such<br>as the NSA and are put out on the<br>Internet to make people feel bad about<br>themselves and thus halting their<br>progress we will talk more about this at<br>a later point within the fifth level of<br>learning another thing I believe we have<br>seen through by now is how Inc and his<br>son are setting up scenarios leading to<br>traps for us to fall into for example we<br>read and the Vedas how the supreme god<br>Vishnu in most cases manifests here on<br>earth through avatars across various<br>ages and time periods to save mankind<br>from evil beans such as the asuras and<br>avatars of Shiva&#39;s it often looks as if<br>vision is a friend of humanity while<br>Shiva is not in reality it&#39;s just a game<br>they play with us because we are<br>considered too stupid to see through it<br>Vishnu and Shiva are never enemies and<br>Vishnu is not a friend of mankind it&#39;s<br>all mind games John Lennon saw already<br>in the 1970s that we are all subjected<br>to mind games so he wrote the song<br>mind games which became the title song<br>on the album with the same name John<br>Lennon was taken out<br>
