<p>This one tells the story of a proto-superman but don't expect a typical super-hero tale. It is a very realistic story of what would happen in real life when you are much more advanced than other human beings in one area. (It's not cheers or admiration but  suspicion, hate, persecution, etc.) Now, you have a chance to read a truly realism-based story about a super-human and his destiny!
But you are warned that it's not a happy jolly story!
