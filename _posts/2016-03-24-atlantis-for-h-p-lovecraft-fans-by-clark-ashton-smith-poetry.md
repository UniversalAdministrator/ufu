  Atlantis (For H. P. Lovecraft Fans) by
  Clark Ashton Smith (Poetry )
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Above its domes the gulfs accumulate
  To where the sea-winds trumpet forth their screed;
  But here the buried waters take no heed—
  Deaf, and with closèd lips from press of weight
  Imposed by ocean.
  Dim, inanimate,
  On temples of an unremembered creed
  Involved in long, slow tentacles of weed,
  The dead tide lies immovable as Fate.
  From out the ponderous-vaulted ocean-dome,
  A clouded light is questionably shed
  On altars of a goddess garlanded
  With blossoms of some weird and hueless vine;
  And wingèd, fleet, through skies beneath the foam,
  Like silent birds the sea-things dart and shine.
  ---End--
