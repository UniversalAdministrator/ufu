hello non-programmers and non-members so<br>I&#39;m gonna show you a book that came<br>across from my research into something<br>that I&#39;m gonna be making a double video<br>about later today it&#39;s just so complex<br>that I can&#39;t figure out how to make it<br>because for me the complexity is in the<br>video not just reviewing the information<br>but giving you the information in a way<br>that inspires you to share it&#39;s a really<br>big problem right because just the fact<br>that you&#39;re a non programmer non-member<br>means that you should really really<br>share this seriously I&#39;m feeling<br>like a broken record<br>so in my research this morning I came<br>across a book called the emotion machine<br>common-sense thinking artificial<br>intelligence in the future of the human<br>mind<br>written by Marvin Minsky yes now let&#39;s<br>get into it<br>to Gloria Margaret Henry and Juliana<br>collaborators push sing see more pepper<br>John McCarthy Oliver Selfridge rja<br>Solomonov in primers Andrew M Gleeson<br>George a Miller JCR Licklider Solomon<br>left her shirts left shits worn s<br>McCullough Claude e Shannon supporters<br>Jeffrey Epstein Kazuhiko Nishi Nicholas<br>Negroponte Harvard Society of fellows<br>Office of Naval Research Toshiba<br>Corporation so I want you to notice the<br>supporters are Jeffrey Epstein first we<br>all know Jeffrey Epstein right we all<br>know who he is<br>if you don&#39;t I&#39;m going to show you in a<br>minute now I&#39;m just gonna go into the<br>table of contents of this book<br>introduction falling in love attachments<br>and goals from pain to suffering<br>consciousness levels of mental<br>activities common sense thinking<br>resourcefulness the self acknowledgments<br>notes bibliography and index the emotion<br>machine is a book about the emotional<br>machine I hope this book will be useful<br>to everyone who seeks ideas about how<br>human minds might work or who wants<br>suggestions about better ways to think<br>or who names towards building smarter<br>machines now I&#39;m not gonna go further<br>into this because you know all you<br>non-programmers non-members it&#39;ll just<br>confuse you in overwhelm you Marvin<br>Minsky that&#39;s Marvin Minsky one of the<br>fathers of artificial intelligence and<br>that&#39;s the guy who was his number-one<br>supporter of his book the emotion<br>machine Jeffrey Epstein<br>okay see marvin minsky was an american<br>cognitive scientist concerned largely<br>with research of artificial intelligence<br>co-founder of the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology&#39;s AI laboratory<br>and author of several texts concerning<br>AI and philosophy he was the co-founder<br>of the AI laboratory at MIT now Jeffrey<br>Epstein he&#39;s a registered sex offender C<br>and at the beginning of this this is one<br>of the big connections is that I keep<br>telling people that these people are<br>very intelligent and they&#39;re super pervs<br>and they&#39;re all connected right so now<br>we&#39;ve connected the father of artificial<br>intelligence and right there and his<br>book the emotion machine his number one<br>Supporter number-one supporter was<br>Jeffrey Epstein Marvin Minsky and<br>Jeffrey Epstein were Bros yet it they<br>were bros<br>now what we need to remember about Aaron<br>Swartz&#39;s Aaron Swartz in 2011 was<br>arrested by MIT police on Breaking and<br>Entering charges after connecting a<br>computer to the MIT network in an<br>unmarked and unlocked closet<br>Aaron Swartz was breaking into this<br>guy&#39;s super creepy AI Network you see<br>what I&#39;m saying now all right that<br>Jeffrey Epstein was help running super<br>creepy network with advanced AI that was<br>developed by Marvin Minsky and friends<br>it&#39;s right there are their buddies look<br>supporters Jeffrey Epstein number one<br>it&#39;s right there it&#39;s in his book so<br>anyway so what I&#39;m gonna say to you<br>right now is if you&#39;re a non programming<br>non member of this super creepy<br>perverted Society of super geniuses with<br>Wiener problems share this video because<br>it&#39;s gonna be important because the next<br>information I show you it&#39;s gonna change<br>future because I&#39;m gonna tell you why<br>the machine name that runs it is called<br>stain so they built a safe machine to<br>run good things like a saint so that you<br>could find documents about it but when<br>they were building the saint marvin<br>minsky and friends they built stain and<br>then they did that for obfuscation and<br>because they like to just be not<br>creative<br>so st. is the cool system like Santa&#39;s<br>is actually very cool to imagine you<br>know simulating your own life in an open<br>environment it&#39;s really kind of an<br>awesome idea but stayin not so cool and<br>you know these guys built it together<br>because they&#39;re buddies they&#39;re ultra<br>rich super elite Creepo<br>buddies<br>and they had to have a system to monitor<br>their super Creepo network it&#39;s right<br>there anyway<br>share like subscribe I proved it to you<br>I&#39;ll give you a link to the book but<br>just the fact that Jeffrey Epstein is<br>the number one supporter of the emotion<br>machine by Marvin Minsky I mean that<br>says something I mean he even put<br>Jeffrey Epstein above the Harvard<br>Society of fellows and Office of Naval<br>Research I mean you know if I was<br>writing a book on AI like seriously I<br>would at least put the Office of Naval<br>Research and Harvard Society of fellows<br>above some dude named Jeffrey Epstein<br>who got arrested for you know being a<br>sex offender I mean so this is this is<br>the plight of our society now because<br>the motion machine which was a book<br>written by the father of artificial<br>intelligence for ever and ever and ever<br>the number one Supporter it&#39;s gonna be<br>recognized as a pedophile right there a<br>pedophile number one Supporter seriously<br>the motion machine it&#39;s number one<br>Supporter is a registered sex offender<br>I&#39;ve seen in 2008 two years after the<br>book was published because that book was<br>published in 2006 in 2008 Epstein was<br>convicted of soliciting an underage girl<br>for prostitution<br>see so the the father of artificial<br>intelligence you know<br>co-founder of mi t--&#39;s AI Laboratories<br>book number one supporters a sex<br>offender and that&#39;s gonna be in the<br>history of the world let people know<br>share like subscribe thanks Marvin<br>
