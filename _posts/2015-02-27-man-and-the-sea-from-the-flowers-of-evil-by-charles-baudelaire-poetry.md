  Man and the Sea (from The Flowers of
  Evil), by Charles Baudelaire, Poetry
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Free man ! the sea is to thee ever dear !
  The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul
  In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll,
  And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.
  Thou delight'st to plunge deep in thine image down ;
  Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace,
  And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface
  With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.
  You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep :
  Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored,
  Oh sea no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard,
  You both are so jealous your secrets to keep !
  And endless ages have wandered by,
  Yet still without pity or mercy you fight,
  So mighty in plunder and death your delight :
  Oh wrestlers ! so constant in enmity !
  ------------- End ---------

<p>Free man ! the sea is to thee ever dear ! 
The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul 
In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll, 
And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.

Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace, 
And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface
