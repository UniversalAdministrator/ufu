perhaps we need some outside universal<br>threat I occasionally think how quickly<br>our differences worldwide would vanish<br>if we were facing an alien threat from<br>outside this world the generation now<br>alive is privileged to see the birth<br>pangs of the birth of a new civilization<br>hello this is a message from the<br>anonymous charity also known as the<br>collective this transmission is dated<br>November 30th 2018 we will be premiering<br>a new in-depth investigation into the<br>worldwide alien sighting and abduction<br>phenomenon on December 8 2018 we will be<br>delving into the coming alien agenda and<br>a possible false flag event that will<br>being their public rollout of the new<br>world order this short video is a sneak<br>peek into some of the topics and<br>questions we will be addressing and<br>answering please subscribe and check<br>back for further daily updates on other<br>issues that the mainstream media and<br>elites are keeping from you thank you<br>today scientists overseas say the world<br>governments should start preparing an<br>action plan just in case earth is<br>contacted by aliens they claim that a<br>branch of the UN should be given<br>responsibility for what they call a<br>super-earth affairs and come up with a<br>detailed response for if or when the<br>extraterrestrials arrived but now the<br>United Nations is getting ready for a<br>contact with aliens from outer space<br>this is Muslim Othman she&#39;s out of<br>Malaysia she will be planet Earth&#39;s<br>first interstellar diplomat an<br>incredible story coming out of the<br>Vatican listen to this the senior<br>Vatican scientist said that he would be<br>delighted if we encountered intelligent<br>aliens and would be happy to baptize<br>them his pronouncement opens up the<br>possibility of space missionaries<br>heading out to the stars to convert<br>aliens to Christianity did the Vatican<br>find ally in life you know<br>it&#39;s sensationalistic if that question<br>sounds it&#39;s really not that far off from<br>what we&#39;ve seen in the news over these<br>last days UFO encounters here on earth<br>but that&#39;s exactly what firefighters are<br>now training for it&#39;s the fire officers<br>guide to disaster control and said to be<br>found in fire houses across the US the<br>book covers everything from fires to<br>floods but it&#39;s chapter 13 that takes an<br>unusual twist in firefighting techniques<br>titled enemy attack in UFO potential it<br>would not be remiss to give some thought<br>to the part that fire departments might<br>play in the event of the unexpected<br>arrival of UFOs in their communities or<br>is it enough to warrant a UFO education<br>red alerts this is something could<br>really happen in our lifetime it even<br>asks how do you treat injured aliens our<br>first responders aware of the potential<br>physical injuries this is a real<br>phenomena that we should deal with we<br>should deal with seriously sometime<br>later this year or next year we expect<br>them to announce astronomers we&#39;ll<br>announce that we found it the Holy Grail<br>I think it&#39;s premature for us to<br>announce our presence in outer space<br>until we know their intention scientists<br>say if they examined all aspects of the<br>search for alien life from astronomy<br>biology to the political and religious<br>fallout or the result from alien contact<br>the report also said that evolution on<br>alien worlds is likely to be Darwinian<br>which may mean extraterrestrials share<br>our tendencies for violence and<br>exploitation<br>so basically when they arrive on earth<br>they&#39;re probably going to be me I&#39;m not<br>kidding one of the scientists actually<br>said prepare for the worst today from<br>science fiction to science fear news<br>buzz among some scientists that if<br>aliens do exist that they&#39;re mostly<br>nasty resource consuming locusts that<br>would stop at nothing to take what they<br>want and destroy anyone in their way if<br>intelligent aliens exist they will look<br>just like us in<br>given our far from glorious history this<br>should give us pause for thought so are<br>they coming to enslave us all and does<br>this mean we have to change our<br>definition of ET from extraterrestrial<br>to evil and terrifying<br>I believe it was extraterrestrial I now<br>believe it is interdimensional the<br>phenomena in other words we&#39;re looking<br>at so-called spirit beings from another<br>dimension byuk waiting into ancient<br>manuscripts where these beings<br>manifested to human being and what their<br>reactions were and then comparing it to<br>reactions present day of people who have<br>had encounters and similarities are<br>striking<br>now the report also says that if ET do<br>come from an earthlike world they could<br>resemble us they might have similar<br>biological molecules so hey that could<br>expand the dating pool but on the chance<br>that there are aliens out there which I<br>totally believe there are imma be with<br>the scientists on this one and say let&#39;s<br>get prepared<br>[Music]<br>what is that on screen no astronomer has<br>seen this before scientists say they&#39;re<br>clueless about what it might be back on<br>the screen what is it<br>we don&#39;t know we are stumped scientists<br>around the world are saying what the<br>heck is this object it doesn&#39;t fit any<br>of the profiles of the usual suspects<br>that&#39;s the problem<br>usual suspects are comet meteor stars<br>jellies planets some sort of alien<br>dealio well you know the object is about<br>the size of the Royal Rose Bowl stadium<br>so it&#39;s too small to be a planet or a<br>star or a galaxy and it&#39;s not a common<br>there&#39;s no gas in the tail that comet<br>it&#39;s not a meteor because it&#39;s not<br>inside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere so what is<br>it we&#39;re scratching our head the only<br>thing we can think of at the present<br>time is a once-in-a-lifetime event the<br>collision of two asteroids in space<br>we&#39;ve never seen that before I try it a<br>month ago we spot this little speck<br>doing all sorts of shenanigans that it<br>shouldn&#39;t be doing the Hubble Space<br>Telescope zooms in on it and we our jaws<br>hit the floor and I&#39;m trying everything<br>now it&#39;s called the P slash 2010 a2 and<br>you say that short for we are occluded<br>but on the chance that there are aliens<br>out there which I totally believe there<br>are I&#39;m gonna be with the scientists on<br>this one and say let&#39;s get prepared<br>my people have developed technologies<br>which allow us to throw off our physical<br>forms and travel great distances in the<br>blink of an eye<br>we are entire log with your leaders to<br>help the human race survive it<br>infinitely for we believe in you we are<br>helping your scientists find cures for<br>diseases which afflict your bodies and<br>helping you to preserve your planet&#39;s<br>most precious resources<br>many among us rage piece and one day<br>with our help or maybe a thing of the<br>past<br>Kalani&#39;s obedient strong and growing we<br>will bring you a cure for many known<br>diseases we will provide technology that<br>will change the way you live<br>we will bring peace to every nation on<br>your planet we are the visitors we are<br>of peace<br>perhaps we need some outside universal<br>threat I occasionally think how quickly<br>our differences worldwide would vanish<br>if we were facing an alien threat from<br>outside this world and we are going to<br>come up against the limits of our own<br>mortality in a way we never could before<br>and a lot of the things that happened<br>good and bad will be stranger than<br>anything ever written in science fiction<br>I believe that now that we know there<br>are not hundreds not millions but<br>billions of other solar systems out<br>there thanks to the Hubble telescope and<br>what we know about black holes in<br>universe and all that the dimensions of<br>physics are such that I would be quite<br>surprised if in the lifetime of people<br>that are no older than 30 here we don&#39;t<br>discover some form of life in another<br>universe so I think there are lots of<br>interesting discoveries biological on<br>earth and other discoveries in the<br>heavens that those of you who are<br>younger will get to see unfold you have<br>all kind of problems with them but on<br>balance it&#39;ll be a plus and it&#39;ll make<br>life much more interesting do believe<br>there are videos now or probably angels<br>in the sky<br>[Music]<br>these events are becoming more and more<br>frequent people are noticing them more<br>and more<br>[Music]<br>okay this is more close-up<br>[Music]<br>[Music]<br>No<br>[Music]<br>the generation now alive is privileged<br>to see the birth pangs of the birth of a<br>new
