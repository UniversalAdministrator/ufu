  A footnote to the video about Neutrino Shape-Shifting:
  
  Sixty Symbols Video on Double Pendulum:
  
  Physics of The Double Pendulum:
  
  Neutral particle oscillation (like neutrino oscillation) is a superposition effect, and a similar effect can also be seen in a coupled double pendulum system where the interaction states are in superpositions of the "free" modes (called eigenstates).
