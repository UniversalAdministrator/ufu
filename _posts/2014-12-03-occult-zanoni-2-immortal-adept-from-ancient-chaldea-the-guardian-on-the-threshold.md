<p>Among all the occult literature, this book offers one of the best in-depth description of "the Dweller of the Threshold". This book offers many occult insights (the author was involved with French Occultist Eliphas Levi as well) too. And the seven parts of this novel give an indication of a sevenfold mystic path of spiritual development lying behind the story itself.
