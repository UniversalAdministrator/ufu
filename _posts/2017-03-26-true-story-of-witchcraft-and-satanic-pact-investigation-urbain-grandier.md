  (If narration is too fast, click "setting" icon of the video and select "speed" option and choose "0.75". I found 0.75 speed sounds the best for this one.) The picture is the copy of Satanic pact of Urbain Grandier produced during the witchcraft trial on him. This was one of the most famous witchcraft trials investigating on selling one's soul to Satan. The copy shows the signature by several demons with their seals, as well as by Satan himself. This version is the masterful retelling of the story by Alexandre Dumas. If you are interested in the subject matter, you don't want to miss this. Enjoy!
