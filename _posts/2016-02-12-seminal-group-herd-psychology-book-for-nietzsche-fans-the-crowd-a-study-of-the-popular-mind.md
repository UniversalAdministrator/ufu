<p>"Civilizations as yet have only been created and directed by a small intellectual aristocracy, never by crowds. Crowds are only powerful for destruction. Their rule is always tantamount to a barbarian phase.", this is one of the most famous words of the author (Gustave Le Bon) and this book is one of the most important books in the field of group-social psychology (or herd psychology that he defined so brilliantly). Although I don't agree with some of his analysis (for example, he criticizes a certain European country regarding certain characteristics but I think every group, crowd, general public from every country has the same 'not so great' traits so I don't agree with him.), as a whole, this work is a masterpiece in terms of describing the characteristics of group mentality, herd mentality, group psychology, etc. without any candy-coating. This is an incredibly insightful writing yet brutally honest so not for the faint heart. Listen to this if you dare!
