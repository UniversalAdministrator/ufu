  A Dead City (For H. P. Lovecraft Fans)
  by Clark Ashton Smith, , Poetry
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Twilight ascends the abandoned ramps of noon
  Within an ancient land, whose after-time
  Unfathomably shadows its ruined prime.
  Like rising mist the night increases soon
  Round shattered palaces, ere yet the moon
  On mute, unsentried walls and turrets climb,
  And touch with pallor of sepulchral rime
  The desert where a city's bones are strewn.
  She comes at last: unsepultured, they show
  In all the hoary starkness of old stone.
  From out a shadow like the lips of Death
  Issues a wind, that through the ruins blown,
  Cries like a prophet's ghost, with waiting breath,
  The weirds of finished and forgotten woe.
  --------- End --------

<p>Twilight ascends the abandoned ramps of noon
Within an ancient land, whose after-time
Unfathomably shadows its ruined prime.
Like rising mist the night increases soon
Round shattered palaces, ere yet the moon
On mute, unsentried walls and turrets climb,
And touch with pallor of sepulchral rime
The desert where a city's bones are strewn.
She comes at last: unsepultured, they show
In all the hoary starkness of old stone.
From out a shadow like the lips of Death
Issues a wind, that through the ruins blown,
Cries like a prophet's ghost, with waiting breath,
The weirds of finished and forgotten woe.
