<p>[How to Think Most Effectively] This book argues that we can be taught to "think well" and discusses the methods to do that. The author emphasized 'the power of thought (his term)" and stressed that our true freedom is 'intellectual' in nature since it determines the dynamics between us and the manifested world around us.
