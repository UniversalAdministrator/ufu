<p>"A Study in Scarlet" is the first ever Sherlock Holmes story split into two quite distinctive parts. The first part is told from the viewpoint of Dr. John Watson and recounts his first experiences of meeting the illustrious Sherlock Holmes and their subsequent co-habitation and crime-solving partnership. The second is told in a third person narrative and is set in the USA, setting an elaborate back-story to the eventual motive of the murderer, before returning to the UK towards the end of part two, the narration, once again, being picked up by Dr. John Watson. - Summary by Robert Dixon
