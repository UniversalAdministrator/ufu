<p>This is an investigation book on the occult phenomena (ghosts and haunted places) written by an author who actually spent 20 years to study the various cases all over the Europe and America. The author was definitely not gullible and well aware of the fact that the most of 'spiritualists' of his era are scammers. So he initiated his investigation in search of genuine occult phenomena (in this case study, 'ghosts' and 'haunted places').
