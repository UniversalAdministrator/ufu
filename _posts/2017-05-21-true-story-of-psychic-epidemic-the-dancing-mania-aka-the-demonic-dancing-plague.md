<p>At the end of the Black Plague, a strange phenomenon appeared throughout the Europe. People started maniacal dancing in the street (sometimes, accompanied with screaming an alien language) that lasted days or even to their death. People started calling it "The Demonic Dancing Plague." Was it demonic possession? Or was it psychic epidemic? Or was it hallucinatory group madness?
