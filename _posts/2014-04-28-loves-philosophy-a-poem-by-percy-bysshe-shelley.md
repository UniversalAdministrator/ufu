post_excerpt: |
  The fountains mingle with the river
  And the rivers with the ocean,
  The winds of heaven mix for ever
  With a sweet emotion;
  Nothing in the world is single;
  All things by a law divine
  In one spirit meet and mingle.
  Why not I with thine?—
  
  See the mountains kiss high heaven
  And the waves clasp one another;
  No sister-flower would be forgiven
  If it disdained its brother;
  And the sunlight clasps the earth
  And the moonbeams kiss the sea:
  What is all this sweet work worth
  If thou kiss not me?
  -End-

<p>The fountains mingle with the river
   And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
   With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
   All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
   Why not I with thine?—

See the mountains kiss high heaven
   And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
   If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea:
What is all this sweet work worth
   If thou kiss not me?
