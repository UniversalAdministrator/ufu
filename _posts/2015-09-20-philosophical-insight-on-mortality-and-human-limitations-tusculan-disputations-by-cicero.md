  (Philosophical Insight on Mortality and
  Human Limitations) Tusculan Disputations
  by Cicero
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Tusculan Disputations (Latin: TUSCULANARUM DISPUTATIONUM) is divided into five books which discuss death, pain, grief, perturbations and virtue. At issue is whether wise people can always be happy regardless of the apparent evil that fortune throws in their way. Andrew Peabody says the A. and M. in the text may stand for Auditor, Adolescens, Atticus or Aulus and Marcus or Magister. Written by Marcus Tullius Cicero. Translated by Charles Duke Yonge. (Summary by Geoffrey Edwards)
