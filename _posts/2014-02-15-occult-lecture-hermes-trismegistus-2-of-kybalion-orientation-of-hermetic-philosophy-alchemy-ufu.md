  I posted this lecture 3 months ago but since I have collected entire series of "Hermeticism/ Hermes Trismegistus" by Mr. Hall, I am re-uploading it in a proper sequence for better understanding.
  If you have already listened to this (Hermes Trismegistus 2 or 3), you might want to go to Hermes Trismegistus 4.
