  Silence (by D. H. Lawrence) Poetry
  Audiobook
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  SINCE I lost you I am silence-haunted,
  Sounds wave their little wings
  A moment, then in weariness settle
  On the flood that soundless swings.
  Whether the people in the street
  Like pattering ripples go by,
  Or whether the theatre sighs and sighs
  With a loud, hoarse sigh:
  Or the wind shakes a ravel of light
  Over the dead-black river,
  Or night's last echoing
  Makes the daybreak shiver:
  I feel the silence waiting
  To take them all up again
  In its vast completeness, enfolding
  The sound of men.

<p>SINCE I lost you I am silence-haunted,
  Sounds wave their little wings
A moment, then in weariness settle
  On the flood that soundless swings.
Whether the people in the street
  Like pattering ripples go by,
Or whether the theatre sighs and sighs
  With a loud, hoarse sigh:
Or the wind shakes a ravel of light

Or night's last echoing
  Makes the daybreak shiver:
I feel the silence waiting
  To take them all up again
In its vast completeness, enfolding
  The sound of men.
