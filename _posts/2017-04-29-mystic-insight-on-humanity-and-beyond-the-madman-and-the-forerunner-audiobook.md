<p>"One day, long before many gods were born, I woke from a deep sleep and found all my masks were stolen, the seven masks I have fashioned an worn in seven lives" (Quoted from the main text.) This masterpiece of Kahlil Gibran shows deep insight and wisdom on Humanity and its complicated conditions. It is very profound and may require multiple read/listen to fully penetrate its meaning. Enjoy!
