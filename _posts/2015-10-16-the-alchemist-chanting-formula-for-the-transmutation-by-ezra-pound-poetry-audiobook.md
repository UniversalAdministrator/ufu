post_excerpt: |
  Sail of Claustra, Aelis, Azalais,
  As you move among the bright trees;
  As your voices, under the larches of Paradise
  Make a clear sound,
  Sail of Claustra, Aelis, Azalais,
  Raimona, Tibors, Berangere,
  'Neath the dark gleam of the sky;
  Under night, the peacock-throated,
  Bring the saffron-coloured shell,
  Bring the red gold of the maple,
  Bring the light of the birch tree in autumn
  Mirals, Cembelins, Audiarda,
  Remember this fire.
  Elain, Tireis, Alcmena
  'Mid the silver rustling of wheat,
  Agradiva, Anhes, Ardenca,
  From the plum-coloured lake, in stillness,
  From the molten dyes of the water
  Bring the burnished nature of fire;
  Briseis, Lianor, Loica,
  From the wide earth and the olive,
  From the poplars weeping their amber,
  By the bright flame of the fishing torch
  Remember this fire.
  Midonz, with the gold of the sun, the leaf of the poplar,
  by the light of the amber,
  Midonz, daughter of the sun, shaft of the tree, silver of
  the leaf, light of the yellow of the amber,
  Midonz, gift of the God, gift of the light, gift of the
  amber of the sun,
  Give light to the metal.
  Anhes of Rocacoart, Ardenca, Aemelis,
  From the power of grass,
  From the white, alive in the seed,
  From the heat of the bud,
  From the copper .of the leaf in autumn,
  From the bronze of the maple, from the sap in the
  bough;
  Lianor, loanna, Loica,
  By the stir of the fin,
  By the trout asleep in the gray-green of water;
  Vanna, Mandetta, Viera, Alodetta, Picarda, Manuela
  From the red gleam of copper,
  Ysaut, Ydone, slight rustling of leaves,
  Vierna, Jocelynn, daring of spirits,
  By the mirror of burnished copper,
  O Queen of Cypress,
  Out of Erebus, the flat-lying breadth,
  Breath that is stretched out beneath the world:
  Out of Erebus, out of the flat waste of air, lying beneath
  the world;
  Out of the brown leaf-brown colourless
  Bring the imperceptible cool.
  Elain, Tireis, Alcmena,
  Quiet this metal!
  Let the manes put off their terror, let them put off their
  aqueous bodies with fire.
  Let them assume the milk-white bodies of agate.
  Let them draw together the bones of the metal.
  Selvaggia, Guiscarda, Mandetta,
  Rain flakes of gold on the water
  Azure and flaking silver of water,
  Alcyon, Phaetona, Alcmena,
  Pallor of silver, pale lustre of Latona,
  By these, from the malevolence of the dew
  Guard this alembic.
  Elain, Tireis, Allodetta
  Quiet this metal.
