  Hi! My name is Henry, I make MinutePhysics, and you can support me on Patreon:
  
  Is it better to walk or run when it's cold out? If you run, then you have to deal with wind, wind chill, etc, but your body generates more heat. If you stay still, standing or walking slowly, you don't generate as much heat, but don't deal with the wind. Note: the simple calculations in this video don't very well take into account the baseline metabolic rate/heat generation, even at rest, of humans.
