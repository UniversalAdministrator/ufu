post_excerpt: |
  Where snails abound in a juicy soil,
  I will dig for myself a fathomless grave,
  Where at leisure mine ancient bones I can coil,
  And sleep quite forgotten like a shark 'neath the wave.
  I hate every tomb I abominate wills,
  And rather than tears from the world to implore,
  I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills
  To devour every bit of my carcass impure.
  Oh worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends !
  To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends,
  Enlivened Philosophers offspring of Dung !
  Without any qualms, o'er my wreckage spread,
  And tell if some torment there still can be wrung
  For this soul-less old frame that is dead 'midst the dead !
  The Joyous Defunct (from "The Flowers of Evil") by Charles Baudelaire [Poetry Audiobook]
