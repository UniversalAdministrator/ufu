  H. P. Lovecraft praised this book as "One of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written". Clark Ashton Smith also said that "In all literature, there are few works so sheerly remarkable, so purely creative, as The Night Land." This is a true masterpiece of horror. Lovecraft fans (or any horror fans for intelligent and imaginative plots) will enjoy this story greatly.
