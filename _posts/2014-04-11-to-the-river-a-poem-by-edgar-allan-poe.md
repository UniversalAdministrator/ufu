post_title: To The River, a Poem by Edgar Allan Poe,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
  Of crystal, wandering water,
  Thou art an emblem of the glow
  Of beauty-the unhidden heart-
  The playful maziness of art
  In old Alberto's daughter;
  But when within thy wave she looks-
  Which glistens then, and trembles-
  Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
  Her worshipper resembles;
  For in his heart, as in thy stream,
  Her image deeply lies-
  His heart which trembles at the beam
  Of her soul-searching eyes.
  -End-

Of beauty-the unhidden heart-

In old Alberto's daughter;

Which glistens then, and trembles-
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart, as in thy stream,
Her image deeply lies-
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul-searching eyes.
