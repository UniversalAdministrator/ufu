<p>The narrator finished reading by just saying "End of chapter one" but it is the end of this short story so don't be confused (the entire story is 15 minutes and 48 seconds). The author was famous for his Gothic horror and suspense tales but in this tale, he effectively tells us a story of inspiring and indomitable human courage.
