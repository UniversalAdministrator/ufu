author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  When the morning white and rosy breaks,
  With the gnawing Ideal, upon the debauchee,
  By the power of a strange decree,
  Within the sotted beast an Angel wakes.
  The mental Heaven's inaccessible blue,
  For wearied mortals that still dream and mourn,
  Expands and sinks ; towards the chasm drawn.
  Thus, cherished goddess, Being pure and true
  Upon the rests of foolish orgy-nights
  Thine image, more sublime, more pink, more clear,
  Before my staring eyes is ever there.
  The sun has darkened all the candle lights ;
  And thus thy spectre like the immortal sun,
  Is ever victorious thou resplendent one !
  --End--

With the gnawing Ideal, upon the debauchee, 
By the power of a strange decree, 
Within the sotted beast an Angel wakes. 
The mental Heaven's inaccessible blue, 
For wearied mortals that still dream and mourn, 
Expands and sinks ; towards the chasm drawn. 
Thus, cherished goddess, Being pure and true 
Upon the rests of foolish orgy-nights 
Thine image, more sublime, more pink, more clear, 
Before my staring eyes is ever there. 
The sun has darkened all the candle lights ; 
And thus thy spectre like the immortal sun, 
Is ever victorious thou resplendent one !
