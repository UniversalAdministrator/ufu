author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Their mouths have drunken the eternal wine—
  The draught that Baal in oblivion sips.
  Unseen about their courts the adder slips,
  Unheard the sucklings of the leopard whine;
  The toad has found a resting-place divine
  And bloats in stupor between Ammon's lips.
  O Carthage and the unreturning ships,
  The fallen pinnacle, the shifting Sign!
  Lo! when I hear from voiceless court and fane
  Time's adoration of Eternity—
  The cry of kingdoms past and gods undone—
  I stand as one whose feet at noontide gain
  A lonely shore; who feels his soul set free,
  And hears the blind sea chanting to the sun.
