<p>Bṛhadāraṇyaka was “composed for the sake of those who wish to liberate themselves from the world, in order that they may acquire the knowledge that the Absolute (Brahman) and the individual are the same”, according to Shankara.  Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is estimated to have been composed about 700 BCE.</p>
