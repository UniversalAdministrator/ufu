<p>AND Urizen read in his Book of Brass in sounding tones:— 
‘Listen, O Daughters, to my voice! listen to the words of wisdom!
Compel the Poor to live upon a crust of bread by soft mild arts: 
So shall you govern over all. 
Let Moral Duty tune your tongue,
But be your hearts harder than the nether millstone;         
To bring the Shadow of Enitharmon beneath our wondrous Tree,
That Los may evaporate like smoke, and be no more. 
Draw down Enitharmon to the Spectre of Urthona, 
And let him have dominion over Los, the terrible Shade. 
Smile when they frown, frown when they smile; and when a man looks pale with labour and abstinence, say he looks healthy and happy; 
And when his children sicken, let them die: 
there are enough born, even too many, and our earth will soon be overrun without these arts. 
If you would make the Poor live with temper, with pomp give every crust of bread you give; with gracious cunning magnify small gifts; reduce the man to want a gift, and then give with pomp. 
Say he smiles, if you hear him sigh; if pale, say he is ruddy. 
Preach temperance: say he is overgorg’d, and drowns his wit 
In strong drink, tho’ you know that bread and water are all 
He can afford. Flatter his wife, pity his children, till we can         
Reduce all to our will, as spaniels are taught with art.’
