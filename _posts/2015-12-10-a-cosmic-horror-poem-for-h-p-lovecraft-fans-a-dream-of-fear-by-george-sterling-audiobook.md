post_excerpt: |
  Unseen the ghostly hand that led,
  I walked where all was darkness, save
  What light the moon, half-wasted, gave
  Above a city of the dead.
  So lone it was, so grey, I deemed
  That death itself was scarce so old;
  The moonlight fell forlorn and cold
  On tombs where Time lay dead, it seemed.
  Within its gates I heard the sound
  Of winds in cypress-caverns caught
  Of huddling trees that moaned, and sought
  To whisper what their roots had found.
  Within its gates my soul was led,
  Down nettle-choked and haunted way-
  An atom of the Dark's dismay,
  In deaf immensities of dread.
  In broken crypts where ghouls had slept
  I saw how muttering devils sate
  (Knowing the final grasp of Fate)
  And told grim auguries, and wept.
  The night was mad with nameless fear.
  The Powers of Darkness feared the gloom.
  From sentried sky to anxious tomb
  Ran messages I bent to hear.
  Mine ears were sealed, nor heard I save
  The secret known to Endor's witch —
  Whispered to lemur and to lich
  From lips made wiser by the grave.
  O'er tarns where spectral vapors flowed
  Antares shook with bloody light,
  And guarded on its haughty flight
  The offended fire of Alphard glowed.
  The menace of infinity
  Constrained the cavern of the skies.
  I felt the gaze of solemn eyes
  In hostile gulfs intent to see;
  Gage of whose imminent designs,
  Satanic Armageddon broke,
  Where monstrous vans in blackness spoke
  The flight of Evil on the Signs —
  Abysmal occultation cast
  By kingdoms of the sunken noon,
  And shadow-shafts that smote the moon
  At altars of the cloven Vast!
  To worlds that faltered on their way
  Python's intolerable hiss
  Told from the jaws of his abyss
  Malign amazement and dismay.
  By god or demon undestroyed,
  In malediction sate the stars,
  Concentered from Titanic wars
  To cry the judgments of the Void.
  Assigned, implacable, supreme,
  The heralds of the Curse came down:
  I felt the eternal bastions' frown;
  I saw colossal cerements gleam.
  Convoking trumpets shook the gloom.
  Their incommunicable word
  Announced o'er Time's foundations, stirred.
  All vasts and covenants of doom.
  I saw the light of dreadful fanes,
  I heard enormous valves resound,
  For aeons sealed in crypts profound,
  And clangor of ascending chains.
