  The Star Treader (For H. P. Lovecraft
  Fans) by Clark Ashton Smith, , Poetry
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  I:   A voice cried to me in a dawn of dreams,
  Saying, "Make haste: the webs of death and birth
  Are brushed away, and all the threads of earth
  Wear to the breaking; spaceward gleams
  Thine ancient pathway of the suns,
  Whose flame is part of thee;
  And deeps outreach immutably
  Whose largeness runs
  Through all thy spirit's mystery.
  Go forth, and tread unharmed the blaze
  Of stars where through thou camest in old days;
  Pierce without fear each vast
  Whose hugeness crushed thee not within the past.
  A hand strikes off the chains of Time,
  A hand swings back the door of years;
  Now fall earth's bonds of gladness and of tears,
  And opens the strait dream to space sublime."
  II  :
  Who rides a dream, what hand shall stay!
  What eye shall note or measure mete
  His passage on a purpose fleet,
  The thread and weaving of his way![7]
  It caught me from the clasping world,
  And swept beyond the brink of Sense,
  My soul was flung, and poised, and whirled,
  Like to a planet chained and hurled
  With solar lightning strong and tense.
  Swift as communicated rays
  That leap from severed suns a gloom
  Within whose waste no suns illume,
  The wingèd dream fulfilled its ways.
  Through years reversed and lit again
  I followed that unending chain
  Wherein the suns are links of light;
  Retraced through lineal, ordered spheres
  The twisting of the threads of years
  In weavings wrought of noon and night;
  Through stars and deeps I watched the dream unroll,
  Those folds that form the raiment of the soul.
  III   :
  Enkindling dawns of memory,
  Each sun had radiance to relume
  A sealed, disused, and darkened room
  Within the soul's immensity.
  Their alien ciphers shown and lit,
  I understood what each had writ
  Upon my spirit's scroll;
  Again I wore mine ancient lives,
  And knew the freedom and the gyves
  That formed and marked my soul.
  IV   :
  I delved in each forgotten mind,
  The units that had builded me,
  Whose deepnesses before were blind
  And formless as infinity—
  Knowing again each former world—
  From planet unto planet whirled
  Through gulfs that mightily divide
  Like to an intervital sleep.
  One world I found, where souls abide
  Like winds that rest upon a rose;
  Thereto they creep
  To loose all burden of old woes.
  And one I knew, where warp of pain
  Is woven in the soul's attire;
  And one, where with new loveliness
  Is strengthened Beauty's olden chain—
  Soft as a sound, and keen as fire—
  In light no darkness may depress.
  V   :
  Where no terrestrial dreams had trod
  My vision entered undismayed,
  And Life her hidden realms displayed
  To me as to a curious god.
  Where colored suns of systems triplicate
  Bestow on planets weird, ineffable,
  Green light that orbs them like an outer sea,
  And large auroral noons that alternate[9]
  With skies like sunset held without abate,
  Life's touch renewed incomprehensibly
  The strains of mirth and grief's harmonious spell.
  Dead passions like to stars relit
  Shone in the gloom of ways forgot;
  Where crownless gods in darkness sit
  The day was full on altars hot.
  I heard—once more a part of it—
  The central music of the Pleiades,
  And to Alcyone my soul
  Swayed with the stars that own her song's control.
  Unchallenged, glad I trod, a revenant
  In worlds Edenic longly lost;
  Or walked in spheres that sing to these,
  O'er space no light has crossed,
  Diverse as Hell's mad antiphone uptossed
  To Heaven's angelic chant.
  VI  :
  What vasts the dream went out to find!
  I seemed beyond the world's recall
  In gulfs where darkness is a wall
  To render strong Antares blind!
  In unimagined spheres I found
  The sequence of my being's round—
  Some life where firstling meed of Song,
  The strange imperishable leaf,
  Was placed on brows that starry Grief
  Had crowned, and Pain anointed long;[10]
  Some avatar where Love
  Sang like the last great star at morn
  Ere Death filled all its sky;
  Some life in fresher years unworn
  Upon a world whereof
  Peace was a robe like to the calms that lie
  On pools aglow with latter spring:
  There Life's pellucid surface took
  Clear image of all things, nor shook
  Till touch of Death's obscuring wing;
  Some earlier awakening
  In pristine years, when giant strife
  Of forces darkly whirled
  First forged the thing called Life—
  Hot from the furnace of the suns—
  Upon the anvil of a world.
  VII   :
  Thus knew I those anterior ones
  Whose lives in mine were blent;
  Till, lo! my dream, that held a night
  Where Rigel sends no word of might,
  Was emptied of the trodden stars,
  And dwindled to the sun's extent—
  The brain's familiar prison-bars,
  And raiment of the sorrow and the mirth
  Wrought by the shuttles intricate of earth.
