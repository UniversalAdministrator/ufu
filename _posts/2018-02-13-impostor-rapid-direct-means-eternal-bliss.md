INTRODUCTION and HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

1. For thousands of years humans have been stuck in
the same pool of inward unsolved problems.

2. Thousands of years ago humans had the problems of suffering, sorrow, anger, fear, violence, conning,
cheating, lying, death, etc.

3. Today humans have the problems of suffering, sorrow, anger, fear, violence, conning, cheating,
lying, death, etc.

4. All of those problems have a single cause.

5. In this book the cause of the lack of progress and
the solution that actually works is revealed.

6. There is a secret, a missing link, a vicious circle, that is keeping humans stuck in the same pool of
unsolved problems.

7. That secret, that missing link, that vicious circle is
revealed in this book.

8. How to break free of that ancient human trap is
also revealed in this book.

9. The solutions taught in the past have failed.

10.
Not even one in a million humans have been freed from all suffering and been established in absolutely perfect
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss by the solutions that have been taught to humanity in the
past.

11.
It is possible to be free of all sorrow and suffering and to experience absolutely perfect infinite eternal joy here and now in this lifetime.

12.
It is possible for all humans, not just a few humans.

13.
There is a rapid means to infinite bliss.

14.
That rapid means is taught in this book.

15.
The strategies the ego uses to avoid liberation and how to end those strategies are also revealed in
this book.

16.
Whatever spiritual path you are on, this book will
be a great help.

17.
The problem of the ego distorting, distracting and keeping the attention directed outward, is a problem shared by all humans, whatever path they
are on.

18.
The ego’s tricks have seldom been looked at in
spiritual literature.

19.
The ego’s tricks are revealed in this book.

20.
How to put an end to the ego’s tricks is also taught in this book, making this book a unique and
immensely valuable contribution.

21.
This book will be a great help to all humans, including those who are not on a spiritual path, because the most rapid means to end suffering and sorrow and to live in awareness love bliss, is of
benefit to all.

HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

22.
When humans are taught to read in school, they are taught to accumulate information and store it in memory in order to be able to pass a test or
exam.

23.
If this same approach to reading is used when reading an authentic spiritual teaching, the human
will miss what is being conveyed.

24.
A completely different approach to reading is needed for spiritual reading.

25.
The purpose of an authentic spiritual teaching is to awaken an experience.

26.
The purpose of an authentic spiritual teaching is to
awaken insight.

27.
To awaken insight, read very slowly.

28.
Stay with one sentence for a very long time before
proceeding to the next sentence.

29.
Do not think about what is being read.

30.
Thinking is the tool of the ego.

31.
Thinking will lead away from insight.

32.
Do not let the ego’s arguments prevent you from
seeing what is being taught.

33.
Do not allow the ego to distort what is being
taught.

34.
Do not allow the ego to add to what is being taught, for that too is a method the ego uses to
distort.

35.
This book is a step-by-step instruction manual.

36.
This book is not for the purpose of intellectual
entertainment.

37.
For human consciousness to be transformed,
something new must be introduced.

38.
This book introduces something new into human
consciousness.

39.
Infinite Love-Bliss is available in this lifetime.

40.
Read each chapter very slowly three times before
proceeding to the next chapter.

Read this introduction slowly three times before reading
Chapter One.

Chapter 1 - THE IMPOSTOR

1. These are the definitions of the words "thought", "ego"
and "Self" that will be used in this book:

2. THOUGHT: thoughts are the words of your language in
your mind.

3. If your native language is English and you write in
English and speak English, those same English words in your mind are thoughts.

4. Some people may speak, write and think in more than
one language.

5. EGO: ego is the thought I.

6. The ego is the I-thought.

7. “I am happy”, “I am sad”, “I did this”, “I did that”.
There are so many sentences that are thought of with the word I in them. That thought “I” in each of those
sentences is the ego.

8. The ego is the idea of a separate, individual identity.

9. The ego identifies with the body and with thought, and
calls the body and thought “I”.

10.
The ego is thought.

11.
The ego is thinking.

12.
SELF: the Self is infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss. Those are five words pointing towards one awareness.
Awareness-love-bliss are not three, they are one.

13.
The Self is the background of awareness.

14.
Because almost all humans are in the habit of looking outward towards thoughts, the body, the world, people, places, things, etc., it appears as though the

background of awareness (the Self) wakes up in the morning and goes to sleep at night.

15.
If one turns the attention towards the background of awareness, eventually it will be discovered that the
background of awareness is continuous and unbroken.

16.
Because almost all humans are in the habit of looking outward towards thoughts, the body, the world, people, places, things, etc., it appears as though the
background of awareness is limited.

17.
If the attention is turned towards that awareness that wakes up in the morning, instead of towards people, places, things, thoughts, etc., eventually it will be discovered that that awareness is
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss.

18.
The background of awareness that wakes up in the morning is there during all the waking hours until one
goes to sleep at night.

19.
Thoughts come and go, but the background of awareness that is aware of the thoughts is there during
all the waking hours and does not come and go.

20.
The background of awareness is the true Self.

21.
Before you learned the language that you now think in,
the background of awareness was there.

22.
Then you learned the word “I” in your language.

23.
Your body was given a name, and when people saw that body they said “There goes John, (or Mike, or Jane, or Julie, or Kumar or Radha) or whatever name
that they gave your body.

24.
Thus the idea “I am John, I am this body” arose.

25.
You existed as the background of awareness before
that I thought arose.

26.
The thought calling its “self” “I” is an imposter “self”.

27.
The background of awareness is the true Self.

28.
The fact that you existed before you learned the words

that later became your thoughts helps to reveal the difference between your true Self and the imposter.

29.
Because you existed as the background of awareness before you learned the language that produced the thoughts you now think in, you can easily see that the
I thought is an imposter.

30.
All thoughts are opposed to your real nature.

31.
You know that thoughts are not part of your true
nature because you had to learn them.

32.
That is why you cannot speak, write and think fluently in languages, because you have not learned, or
brought in those languages from the outside.

33.
You can observe that same process in an infant.

34.
You can see that an infant is aware before it learns any
language.

35.
You can observe the child growing older and learning a
language.

36.
You can observe when the child learns the word I and
when the child begins to say the word “I”.

37.
Being able to see how the imposter arose in you and how the imposter arises in every human infant and
child are very important tools.

38.
The reason they are very important tools is because you do not have to rely totally upon those who have ended the imposter and who have awakened from the human dream to tell you that the ego is something
acquired and not natural and is an imposter.

39.
You can observe this for yourself.

40.
Thought is something foreign, alien to the true Self.

41.
Thought pretends to be the Self.

42.
Thought is not the Self.

43.
Thought is an imposter.

44.
Thought believes that it is a real entity and that it is a real self.

45.
Thought is not a real entity and thought is not a self.

46.
Living from thought instead of living from Awareness is
the cause of all human suffering.

47.
The imposter is the cause of all human problems,
sorrow and suffering.

48.
The background of awareness is the true Self.

49.
The awareness that wakes up in the morning is the
true Self.

50.
The awareness that is looking through your eyes now
is the true Self.

51.
As an example for clarification, you could view thinking
and memory as something like a computer program.

52.
Within that computer program is a virus.

53.
The virus is called the “I thought”.

54.
The virus controls the program. The I thought controls
all thinking.

55.
The virus pretends to be your self. The I thought
pretends to be your self.

56.
The virus creates tremendous sorrow and suffering. The I thought creates tremendous sorrow and
suffering.

57.
None of the sorrow or suffering is needed.

58.
What is needed is to delete the virus that pretends to
be “I”. What is needed is to delete the imposter self.

59.
When one attempts to delete the virus, the virus sends out many thoughts stating that deleting the virus is not
a good idea.

60.
The virus has many strategies to preserve the illusion that it is real and to continue the delusion that it is the real self.

61.
In humans the program that came from the outside and took control of their awareness is called thought, language, thinking.

62.
In humans the virus is called the ego or the I thought.

63.
The I thought (ego) is an imposter pretending to be
the Self.

64.
The ego is the cause of all human sorrow and suffering.

65.
The ego is the cause of all disease, death, war, fear,
anger and violence.

66.
Human beings have made almost no inward progress
for thousands of years toward ending suffering, sorrow, war, fear, anger, violence and lying.

67.
Thousands of years ago humans had suffering, sorrow,
war, fear, anger, violence and lying.

68.
Today humans have suffering, sorrow, war, fear,
anger, violence and lying.

69.
What has kept humans in the same pool of inward
unsolved problems?

70.
The ego (the imposter) has kept humans in the same
pool of inward unsolved problems.

71.
Inward problems cannot be solved by looking outward.

72.
Inward problems can only be solved by looking inward.

73.
The ego knows that if the attention is turned inward, the ego will be found to be a myth, an imposter, an
illusion.

74.
Therefore, due to the ego’s fear of ending, the ego
keeps the attention directed outward.

75.
Even when there is an attempt to turn the attention inward, usually due to not understanding the meaning
of looking inward, people are still looking outward.

76.
Humans are slaves to an imposter “self”.

77.
Exposing the strategies of that imposter “self”, how to

put an end to those strategies, how to bring the imposter “self” to an end, thus ending all suffering and sorrow and remaining in the true Self whose nature is infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss are the primary purposes of this book.

78.
Ending the ego does not end the body.

79.
After the ego ends, the body will live out the natural
course of its life.

80.
One should never attempt to harm the body.

81.
The ego is the I-thought.

82.
Ending the ego is ending the I thought.

83.
Ending the bodily life will not end the ego.

84.
The ego will just create the dream of a new body when
the old body ends.

85.
Thus ending the body does not help to solve the
problems.

86.
Humans almost always have their attention directed
outward towards thoughts, people, places, things, etc.

87.
The background of awareness is the true Self, and it is
almost always ignored.

88.
Your true Self deserves to be paid attention to.

89.
When a human turns their attention away from thoughts, the body, the world, people, places, things, experiences, etc. and towards their awareness,
eventually they will directly experience their true Self.

90.
The imposter (thought) pretending to be your self and calling its pretend self “I” should not be tolerated even
for one moment.

91.
Especially an imposter that has created so much suffering and sorrow should not be tolerated even for
one moment.

92.
The imposter (thought) is like a parasite.

93.
Because the ego believes it is a real entity, the ego is afraid of ending.

94.
The ego controls all thinking.

95.
Because the ego is afraid of ending and controls all thinking, the ego directs thought in ways that will preserve its imaginary self so that its imaginary self is
not brought to an end.

96.
The purpose of the teachings in this book is to bring the imposter to an end so that what remains is only the true Self whose nature is:
infinite-eternal-awareness-bliss-love.

97.
When the imposter ends, all suffering and sorrow also
end.

98.
Thinking that thinking or thought is your self is a
delusion, a dream-like illusion.

99.
Thinking that you are a body living in a world is a
delusion, a dream-like illusion.

100.
Thought has created those delusions.

101.
All sorrow, suffering and delusions have one single
root.

102.
The single root is thought.

103.
The root of thought is the I thought.

104.
The root of thought is the thought I.

105.
Thought is not part of your true nature. Thought is
something you learned.

106.
Do not let something you acquired pretend to be your
self.

107.
Chapter One contains a description of the secret that has enslaved humanity for as long as there have been
humans.

Read Chapter One very slowly three times before reading
Chapter Two.

Chapter 2 - THE IMPOSTOR'S TRICKS

1. The ego controls all thinking.

2. The ego can create an argument against anything.

3. Therefore, reserve all arguments against what is being presented here until you have read the book at least
three times.

4. Otherwise, the ego will generate arguments against any anti-ego presentation, thus blocking what is being
presented.

5. See the vicious circle:

6. The ego in its attempts to block the ego from being exposed for the imposter that it is, and to block the realization that the ego is the cause of all human sorrow and suffering, creates arguments against what
is being revealed in this book.

7. Because the ego sets the standards for the debate, the
ego always wins the debate.

8. The way to break that vicious circle is to delay all arguments against what is being presented here until you have read the book very slowly at least three
times.

9. When the ego forms an argument against what is being presented in this book, see the argument as an ego preservation strategy and ignore it, delaying all
argument until the presentation is complete.

10.
Having the motivation to understand, instead of to argue, will help to produce an insight into what is being
presented here.

11.
Put the arguments on hold until you have read the book at least three times.

12.
By that time you may be so skilled at recognizing the ego’s preservation strategies, you may decide to delay the arguments forever.

13.
At least give what is being presented here a fair chance by being aware of the arguments that the ego creates and disregarding those arguments until an insight into
what is being presented here is awakened.

14.
Plenty of time to argue later, after you have read the
entire book.

15.
The ego has been deceiving humans for as long as
there have been humans.

16.
Be aware of when the ego is trying to deceive you.

17.
The ego controls all thinking, therefore, various combinations of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and opinions are the ego’s primary tools to preserve the ego’s imaginary “self” and to prevent you from discovering
your true Self.

18.
Most humans live their entire lives without ever having
observed the background of awareness.

19.
Therefore, whatever opinions most people have about what the background of awareness is, what are its
qualities, what is the true Self, etc., have no basis.

20.
If you observe the background of awareness for many hours everyday for a number of years, then you will eventually know that your awareness is:
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss.

21.
Because most humans spend their entire lifetime looking outward at thoughts, the body, the world, people, places, things, etc., most humans have never even once observed their own awareness, not even for
one second, in their entire lifetime.

22.
What is important are not concepts, beliefs or
conclusions. What is important is Direct Experience.

23.
Be aware of your thoughts, ideas, beliefs and opinions and see how they are serving the ego.

24.
See Chapter One for a clarification of the difference between the ego and the true Self.

25.
What is being presented here in this book is a practical guide to Direct Experience, not some theory for
intellectual entertainment.

26.
Because the ego is afraid of ending, the ego directs and creates thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs and opinions that will help the ego to continue its illusion of being real and to prevent it from being brought to an
end.

27.
Those concepts are ego preservation strategies. Those
concepts are the ego’s tricks.

28.
Because thoughts can be combined in trillions of combinations, the ego can create trillions of
preservation strategies.

29.
The ego has the ability to hide what it is doing from
itself.

30.
The ego can be creating preservation strategies throughout the day and you may not be aware that the ego has been creating preservation strategies
throughout the entire day.

31.
If you are not aware of how the ego preserves its imaginary self, then the ego succeeds in preserving its
imaginary self.

32.
One of the purposes of this book is to look in detail at
how the ego preserves its imaginary self.

33.
If one million people study a spiritual teaching and only one of those people ends the ego illusion, why did the other nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine miss the opportunity?

34.
The reason the other nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine missed the
opportunity is because of the ego’s fear of ending.

35.
Due to the ego’s fear of ending, the ego creates strategies to preserve its imaginary self.

36.
Distorting the teachings is one of the many strategies the ego has to preserve its imaginary self.

37.
That applies to the teachings in the book you are now
reading and to other spiritual teachings.

38.
Right from the beginning, the ego’s preservation strategies have to be dealt with, otherwise the ego would block out what is being presented here in this
book.

39.
Then, instead of being an extraordinary journey, this
would be just one more failed attempt.

40.
The ego’s preservation strategies can be brought to an
end and we will look at how to do that in this book.

41.
Usually any mention of exposing the ego’s preservation
strategies makes the ego run the other way.

42.
To be willing to look at the ego’s preservation
strategies is a sign of spiritual maturity.

43.
Most people are not willing to look at the ego’s
preservation strategies.

44.
Reading a book that reveals some of the ego’s preservation strategies does not make one immune to
them.

45.
One of the ego’s preservation strategies is the thought
“This does not apply to me”.

46.
The ego is very tricky and deceptive in all humans. The ego is a liar in all humans. The ego lies to its imaginary
self.

47.
Therefore, when something is pointed out in this book and you think “This does not apply to me”, take a
second look.

48.
Maybe it does apply to you and the ego is blocking that
fact out, as a preservation strategy.

49.
Challenge the thought “This does not apply to me”.

50.
The thought “This does not apply to me” may be an ego preservation strategy.

51.
One of the differences between the one out of a million who awakens and the nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine who do not, is the ability to stay focused on an essential point until it becomes an insight and a tool that you can use.

52.
The fact that the intellect understands what is written
here is not enough.

53.
The book you are now reading is filled with the insights that lay the foundation to be the one who awakens and not one of the nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine
hundred ninety-nine who miss.

54.
Dwell on what is written in every sentence in every chapter until an insight is awakened that becomes a
tool you can use.

55.
To awaken insight, don’t read what is written like you were reading a newspaper or a book of trivia, and don’t
read for the purpose of gathering information.

56.
To awaken insight, read as though you were reading instructions about how to fly that are vital so that you
do not crash.

57.
Slowly reflect on each line.

58.
That is why the sentences are often separated with a space between them, to encourage you to slowly reflect on them and not to be in a hurry to get to the
next sentence.

59.
Continue to read and re-read long after the intellect
has understood the meaning of the words.

60.
Reading very, very slowly is insight reading.

61.
Read very, very slowly.

62.
The ego is like an inchworm that lets go of one thought
only when it has grabbed hold of the next thought.

63.
Therefore, when re-reading every chapter over and over, don’t be in a hurry to proceed to the next
sentence.

64.
It is important to understand the difference between

insight and intellectual understanding.

65.
Never confuse intellectual understanding with insight.

66.
Intellectual understanding, which is to understand the
words, is good as a first step.

67.
However, after one has understood the words, if one then goes on to another concept before the insight has been awakened, the words will become obstacles and hindrances to ending the ego instead of tools that end
the ego.

68.
Intellectual “understanding”, an intellectual appetite and an intellectual approach to “spirituality” are what characterize the nine hundred ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred ninety-nine who miss.

69.
Insight is what characterizes the one in a million who
brings the ego to its final end.

70.
Most people study “spiritual” teachings because they
enjoy the concepts.

71.
The ego is fundamentally dishonest in humans and has the ability to hide what it is doing from its imaginary
“self”.

72.
Therefore, most people may not allow themselves to see that they are studying “spiritual” teachings
because they enjoy the concepts.

73.
The desire to go quickly to the next concept and to gather more and more information and to read more and more spiritual books and to think about what has been read and to discuss what has been read and thought about are symptoms of the intellectual
appetite and are symptoms of intellectual “spirituality”.

74.
Approaching the study of spiritual teachings intellectually, as just described (73) is an approach that the nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine
hundred ninety-nine who miss use.

75.
There are no opinions, philosophies or beliefs being presented in this book.

76.
The report of Direct Experience and a practical guide to Direct Experience is what is being presented in this book.

77.
What is being pointed towards in this book are not
ideas.

78.
What is being pointed towards in this book is the awareness that is prior to thought and how to directly
experience that awareness.

79.
The ego likes to scatter attention.

80.
Scattering attention is one of the ego’s preservation
strategies.

81.
Thinking is scattering the attention.

82.
To bring the attention to a single point and to dwell on that single point for a very long time is the way to
awaken insight.

83.
Insight is not thinking and insight is not belief.

84.
Insight is: a permanent new perspective.

85.
To find one powerful quote, not a quote that the ego that wishes to preserve itself selects, and to stay with that quote until insight awakens is the kind of approach the one in a million who brings the ego to its final end
uses.

86.
One might stay with a single quote for one day or one week or much longer than one week. Those who use
this approach are rare.

87.
Keeping the attention directed outward is one of the
ego’s fundamental tricks.

88.
Creating unnecessary activities is one way the ego keeps attention directed outward and is another of the
ego’s tricks.

89.
Dropping all unnecessary activities, to create the maximum amount of time for spiritual practice, is an
essential key to bringing the ego to its final end.

90.
Pretending a journey through thought is an authentic

spiritual journey is also one of the ego’s tricks.

91.
The ego has as many tricks to draw upon as there are
concepts, ideas, beliefs and opinions.

92.
Choosing belief instead of Direct Experience is one of
the ego’s tricks.

93.
Wasting time is one of the ego’s tricks.

94.
Spending time in entertainment that could have been
spent in spiritual practice is one of the ego’s tricks.

95.
Almost all thoughts are just the ego’s tricks.

96.
Reflect on one sentence for a very long time before
reading the next sentence.

97.
Reflecting means looking.

98.
Reflecting does not mean thinking and reflecting does
not mean arguing.

99.
Stay with each sentence until you have an insight into
it.

100.
The previous sentence (99) describes a key approach that the one in a million who succeeds in living in
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss uses.

101.
There are a few key principles to be understood and a
little reading may be required for that.

102.
However, to go on and on reading spiritual books is an
ego preservation strategy, another of the ego’s tricks.

103.
Most reading, discussing and thinking about spiritual
teachings is an ego trick.

104.
The ego keeps thoughts about spiritual concepts going
to avoid the practice that leads to the ego’s final end.

105.
The ego keeps people lost in an endless maze of
concepts.

106.
Spiritual concepts do not lead to freedom.

107.
Only practice leads to freedom.

108.
However, it must be the most rapid and direct practice and not a practice created by or distorted by the ego.

Read Chapter Two very slowly three times before reading
Chapter Three.

Chapter 3 - THE IMPOSTOR'S TOOLS:
THOUGHT, THINKING, AND BELIEFS

1. Thought is the primary tool the ego uses to preserve
its imaginary self.

2. Therefore, it is important to see how the ego uses
thought to create ego preservation strategies.

3. First one must understand the nature of thinking, thought, concepts and beliefs and the myths the ego has created about thinking, thought, concepts and
beliefs.

4. Thought is not a means to discover the absolute Truth.

5. The ego has convinced almost all humans and almost all spiritual aspirants that thought is a means to know
the absolute Truth.

6. There are those people who think they already know that thought is not a means to know the absolute
Truth.

7. Almost all of those people are still trying to use thought
as a means to know the absolute Truth.

8. That means that they do not really know that thought
is not a means to know the absolute Truth.

9. They have confused knowing-insight-awareness with
conceptual “knowing”.

10.
People tend to believe their own thinking.

11.
Thinking is controlled by the ego and the ego uses
thought to preserve its imaginary self.

12.
Therefore, to believe one’s own thinking is an error that results in failure to end the ego.

13.
#11 and #12 above are very powerful keys.

14.
For those few individuals who are seriously intent on liberation, it is essential to stop using thought as a
means to know the absolute Truth.

15.
It is also essential to stop believing your own thoughts.

16.
Understanding the nature of beliefs can help one to see that thought is not a means to know the absolute
Truth.

17.
Seeing that thought is not a means to know the absolute Truth is the way to stop using thought as a
means to know the absolute Truth.

18.
There is a method you can try that reveals that
thought is not a means to know the absolute Truth.

19.
We can call it the “How Do You Know Method”.

20.
Here are the instructions for the How Do You Know
Method:

21.
Look at any belief you have.

22.
Ask of that belief “How do I know absolutely for sure
that is true?”.

23.
The mind will give an answer.

24.
To the answer the mind gives ask “How do I know
absolutely for sure that is true?”.

25.
Every time the mind gives an answer, question the answer, by repeating the question “How do I know
absolutely for sure that is true?”.

26.
You must be willing to question every answer the mind
gives for the process to work.

27.
If you are willing to question every answer the mind gives to the question “How do I know absolutely for sure that is true?”, the inquiry will always end in “I
don’t know absolutely for sure that is true”.

28.
The How Do You Know Method is an excellent way to see the difference between believing and knowing.

29.
The How Do You Know Method is also an excellent way to see that thought is not a means to know the absolute Truth.

30.
After questioning a few hundred beliefs, it should be quite clear that thought is not a means to know the
absolute Truth.

31.
Thought is like a great pretense or house of cards.

32.
One idea is supported by another idea.

33.
The How Do You Know Method is a way to see that when you trace each idea back, you find that there is
actually no real foundation at all.

34.
There is another way to see that thought is not a way to know the absolute Truth, understand the nature of belief and concepts, see how belief is formed and how the ego creates ideas that will serve to preserve its
imaginary self.

35.
We can call this the “Arguing Both Sides Method”.

36.
The Arguing Both Sides Method is to look at some
belief you have, maybe one of the current issues of the day.

37.
Write an argument for the side of the belief you are on.

38.
In other words, take a belief you have and write up all the proofs, arguments, evidence and reasons you have
for that belief.

39.
Next, pretend that you have the opposite belief and write up all the proofs, arguments, evidence and
reasons you have for that opposite belief.

40.
The purpose of the Arguing Both Sides Method is to demonstrate that thought can create reasons, evidence
and support for any belief.

41.
Seeing that thought can create evidence and reasons
to support any belief is a very powerful key.

42.
The Arguing Both Sides Method is another way of showing that thought is really baseless.

43.
The Arguing Both Sides Method also demonstrates that thought forms conclusions based on motive.

44.
Evidence is not the primary factor that determines
what conclusions and beliefs will be formed.

45.
Motivation is the primary factor in the forming of
beliefs.

46.
Evidence will be gathered to support the motive.

47.
Whatever the ego wants to believe, the ego will gather all the so-called evidence and reasons to support what
the ego wants to believe.

48.
The ego’s primary motive is to preserve its imaginary
self.

49.
Therefore, the ego directs thought to create concepts
that will help to preserve the ego’s imaginary self.

50.
In almost all humans, including almost all spiritual aspirants and students, the desire of the ego to
preserve its imaginary self is very strong.

51.
In almost all humans and almost all spiritual aspirants and students, the ego is directing thought to create
concepts that will preserve the ego’s imaginary self.

52.
One way the ego does this is to select spiritual paths
that are not direct.

53.
Even if one manages to find the Direct Path, the ego will distort the Direct Path by interpreting what is written or said in a way that supports the ego or by
focusing on that which is not essential.

54.
One of the tricks that the ego uses most commonly with spiritual aspirants is to confuse intellectual
“spirituality” with authentic spirituality.

55.
Most people only have an intellectual interest in
spiritual concepts and do not wish to end the ego.

56.
Most people are just enjoying learning about the
concepts.

57.
There are some people who realize that their interest is

only intellectual.

58.
There are other people who believe that they have an interest in ending the ego, who do not really have an
interest in ending the ego.

59.
Almost all of the people who are on a spiritual path that claims to have as its aim the ending of the ego
illusion, have very little desire to actually end the ego.

60.
The way to end all of the ego’s preservation strategies
is to increase the desire for liberation.

61.
There are a few very condensed Direct Path teachings
that can be a great help on the Direct Path.

62.
You will find those Direct Path teachings in the book
you are now reading.

63.
However, to go on and on reading books and discussing spiritual teachings is an ego preservation strategy to keep you in the realm of thought instead of
practice.

64.
All of the time you spend reading and discussing could
be better spent in practice.

65.
Practice leads to liberation.

66.
Endless reading and discussing leads to illusion.

67.
The ego creates arguments against the Direct Path as a
preservation strategy.

68.
The ego calls indirect paths direct paths as an ego
preservation strategy.

69.
Instead of spending all one’s spare time in spiritual practice, the ego finds endless ways to spend one’s spare time such as television, entertainment, reading, discussing, thinking, etc. and that is one of the ego’s
primary preservation strategies.

70.
If you were to drop all of your unnecessary activities,
you would have much more time for spiritual practice.

71.
One ego preservation strategy (imposter trick) is creating arguments against what is written here

instead of open mindedly considering the possibility that what is being revealed in this book is pointing towards the truth that the ego usually never allows people to see.

72.
Another ego preservation strategy (trick the imposter uses) is deciding in advance that one of the methods will not work, without ever giving the method a sincere
try.

73.
See how the ego is directing every thought you think
to create a way to preserve its imaginary self.

74.
In other words, ask of every thought, idea, concept, belief, etc. “Does this thought, idea, concept or belief
help the ego illusion to continue?”.

75.
When you form a belief, you are no closer to discovering the absolute Truth than before you formed
the belief.

76.
When you form a belief, you have created an obstacle
to discovering the absolute Truth.

77.
If you were honest, your view would be “I don’t know”.

78.
If you really wanted Truth you would insist on Direct
Experience.

79.
If you really wanted Truth, you would never accept a belief. A belief is only a group of symbols. All words are
symbols.

80.
The extremely intense desire for liberation is the key to ending the ego’s tricks and the book you are now reading contains step-by-step instructions in how to
awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation.

81.
This book is also for the purpose of exposing the
strategies the ego uses to preserve its imaginary self.

82.
Reading this book is a good first step.

83.
Repeated reading, over and over, reflecting on each
sentence is very important.

84.
The motivation while reading is very important also.

85.
The correct motivations are (86 - 89):

86.
Extremely intense Self-honesty.

87.
An extremely intense desire to know the Truth.

88.
A willingness to let go of all the ideas you have
accumulated in the past.

89.
An extremely intense longing to be free of sorrow and
to live in joy.

90.
If the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened in you, the Clarity, Honesty, Insight, Integrity and Earnestness that the extremely intense desire for liberation brings, will not allow the desire for
liberation to become weak again.

91.
If the desire for liberation becomes weak, it means that the extremely intense desire for liberation has not yet
been awakened in you.

92.
When the extremely intense desire for Freedom is awakened, Clarity, Sincerity, Earnestness, Insight and Discernment are also awakened and then you can see
what is essential and what is not essential.

93.
The end of the ego is the end of all suffering and all
sorrow for all eternity.

94.
The end of the ego is
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss.

95.
Realize that ending the ego is the only truly worthwhile
event that can happen in a human life.

96.
Take a look at your actions moment by moment to see if they conform to the realization that ending the ego is the only truly valuable thing that can happen in a
human life.

97.
The ego projects thoughts and fantasies and the ego
interprets.

98.
One way to stop this distortion is to ask “Is this
thought I am having about what I am reading, really in the words I am reading, or have I added a thought that is not there in the words I am reading?”.

99.
Another way to stop the distortion is to ask “Have I added a concept or interpretation to what I am reading?”.

100.
Most people project much thinking unto the teachings
that they read.

101.
Their thinking has very little to do with the teachings
they have read.

102.
Most people are in a state of chaotic confusion.

103.
Most people do not realize they are in a state of chaotic
confusion.

104.
Thinking about and interpreting what is written is an
expression of that chaotic confusion.

105.
Actually practicing #98 and #99 above can help
greatly to end that distortion.

106.
Awakening the extremely intense desire for liberation
will stop the ego from creating preservation strategies.

107.
Chapter Four is about the importance of awakening the
extremely intense desire for liberation.

Reach Chapter Three very slowly three times before reading Chapter Four.

Chapter 4 - THE DESIRE FOR LIBERATION

1. Awakening the extremely intense desire for Liberation is the most important first step that can be taken
towards being liberated here and now in this lifetime.

2. The extremely intense desire for liberation is (3 - 7):

3. The extremely intense desire for the realization of the
absolute Truth.

4. The extremely intense longing for the ending of sorrow
and the experience of Eternal-Love-Joy.

5. The extremely intense desire to experience who or
what you really are at your core and to live eternally as your true Self.

6. The extremely intense desire for freedom from all illusion and delusion and freedom from the ego that is
the source of all illusion and delusion.

7. The extremely intense desire to awaken from the
human nightmare.

8. The extremely intense desire for liberation is the
foundation of all true spirituality.

9. Of all of the factors that determine whether you will or will not be free, the intensity or lack of intensity of
your desire for liberation is the most essential factor.

10.
Therefore, whatever you can do to most effectively
increase your desire for liberation should be done.

11.
Spiritual teachings are not all equal.

12.
Some teachings are essential powerful keys.

13.
The knowledge that increasing your desire for liberation is the most effective first step you can take,

is an essential powerful key.

14.
All obstacles that appear in your journey to freedom
are caused by too little desire for freedom.

15.
Even a little increase in your desire for freedom is
helpful.

16.
As your desire for freedom grows in intensity the ego
creates fewer obstacles.

17.
When your desire for freedom becomes very intense, your desire for freedom demands that you take no
detours.

18.
When your desire for freedom becomes very intense, for the first time you can see what is essential for
freedom and what is not essential.

19.
When the desire for freedom is weak, the ego will not
allow you to see the ego’s preservation strategies.

20.
When the desire for freedom is stronger, you can begin
to see the ego’s preservation strategies.

21.
When the desire for freedom becomes even stronger, the desire for freedom itself will bring you everything you need to succeed in your quest for liberation including the answer to all your questions, finding the
Direct Path teachings, the solution to all obstacles, etc.

22.
You will also be able to see how, before the awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation, the ego was selecting spiritual teachings that would help to
preserve it.

23.
When the desire for freedom becomes even more intense, you can see all of the ego’s preservation
strategies.

24.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will marvel at how it was possible that you did not see the ego’s preservation strategies
before.

25.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be able to see how the ego

distorted even the Direct Path teachings.

26.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be able to see that every spiritual teaching from the past has been distorted by the ego and that some of the spiritual teachings from the past were created by the ego for the purpose of preserving
the ego.

27.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be able to see that almost all of the spiritual and religious teachings of the past are
distractions and detours that serve the ego.

28.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will marvel at how the ego did not let
you see before.

29.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will see the endless maze of concepts
the ego has created to trap your attention.

30.
When the desire for freedom becomes even more intense, the ego will no longer create preservation
strategies.

31.
The extremely intense desire for the Direct Experience of the absolute Truth will guide you to your inner
Teacher.

32.
The extremely intense desire for Truth will guide you to the practice that gives the Direct Experience of eternal
life.

33.
The intensity of the desire for the realization of the
Truth is the key.

34.
Increasing your desire for the absolute Truth is the
most important step.

35.
Increasing the desire for freedom must be the first
step.

36.
Without an increase in your desire for freedom, all of your attempts at awakening will fail to produce eternal experience.

37.
Without an increase in your desire for freedom, the ego will distort all your spiritual studies, including what you read in the book you are now reading.

38.
Without an increase in your desire for freedom, the ego
will never allow you to see the Truth.

39.
Another great key is self-honesty.

40.
Self-honesty will help in all aspects of the quest for
liberation.

41.
Self-honesty will help you to increase your desire for
liberation.

42.
Self-honesty means to be as honest as you can be.

43.
Self-honesty means to be 100% honest with your self,
all of the time.

44.
Catch your ego using preservation strategies.

45.
See your ego creating arguments that lead you away
from the Direct Path.

46.
What if your desire for liberation were to double from
its present level?

47.
If your desire for liberation were to double from its
present level, that would be a huge help.

48.
If your desire for liberation were to double from its present level, immediately you would begin to see
what you have never been able to see before.

49.
What if your desire for liberation were a million times
greater and more intense than it is now?

50.
Really, even if your desire for liberation doubles or triples, great changes will occur in what the ego allows
you to see.

51.
When your desire for liberation increases greatly, every
moment of your life will be dedicated to your liberation.

52.
That great intense desire for liberation itself will demand that you do not waste even one moment of time, and it will demand that you stop the ego lies, and

that you drop that which is not essential.

53.
The wonderful thing is, it is that same extreme desire for liberation that brings you the knowledge of what is essential and what is not essential and allows you to
see for the first time in your life.

54.
Before the extremely intense desire for freedom arises,
you think you can see, but you are really blind.

55.
After the extremely intense desire for freedom arises,
all is made clear and you have no doubts!

56.
After the extremely intense desire for freedom arises,
for the first time you can see!

57.
If the extremely intense desire for liberation does not
arise in you (58 - 62):

58.
None of the words in this book will be of any benefit to
you.

59.
The ego will interpret what is written here in the book
you are now reading.

60.
The ego will create arguments against what is written
here.

61.
Instead of seeing what you read literally, without any
interpretation, the ego will begin to interpret.

62.
The ego will change the teachings into something that preserves the ego instead of something that brings the
ego to its final end.

63.
Therefore, the key to everything is to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation and to make
that desire for freedom grow everyday.

64.
One of the most powerful tools or keys you can have is
to change the way you read.

65.
Read extremely slowly, reflecting on a single phrase or
a single sentence.

66.
Make sure you see the meaning of the sentence before proceeding to the next sentence.

67.
In other words: when reading pause, stop and look.

68.
Read the same quote three times before proceeding to
the next quote.

69.
If the desire for freedom is not great enough in you,
the ego will always find a way to occupy your time with something other than spiritual practice.

70.
Thus the key to bringing the ego to an end is the
intensity of the desire for freedom.

71.
Eagerness for liberation must be equal to the eagerness someone who is being held underwater has
for trying to rise to the surface.

72.
Reflect on #71 above.

73.
Eagerness is another word for the desire for freedom.

74.
How great, how intense is the desire of someone being
held underwater trying to rise to the surface.

75.
He would like to rise to the surface, but he is being
held underwater.

76.
See how intense his desire is to rise to the surface.

77.
Every second his desire to rise to the surface is
becoming more and more intense.

78.
After one minute, how the intensity of his desire has
increased.

79.
After two minutes underwater, the desire for oxygen and therefore his desire to rise to the surface, is ten
times greater.

80.
After three minutes underwater, his desire to rise to
the surface is one hundred times greater.

81.
After four minutes underwater, his desire to rise to the
surface is one thousand times greater.

82.
How great, how intense is his desire?

83.
That is how intense your desire for liberation must become.

84.
If the extremely intense desire for freedom is not there, you can always find a way to avoid spiritual practice.

85.
There is almost no limit to the ego’s capacity to distort.

86.
If there was a book written by an awakened sage that was one thousand pages long and on every page the only words that were written were the following exact
same words repeated on every page (87 - 93):

87.
The only effective means to end the ego illusion is to
(88 - 93):

88.
Turn your attention away from thought, the body, the world, people, places, things, experiences, etc. and
towards awareness watching awareness.

89.
If through other means you attempt to bring the ego to an end, the ego will appear to have ended, but will
re-appear again later.

90.
There are therefore, no other effective means to end the ego, to end all suffering and all sorrow and to live
eternally as infinite-awareness-love-bliss.

91.
Start by setting aside at least two hours per day with no other activities for your practice of awareness
watching awareness.

92.
If you can create more than two hours for practice by
dropping unnecessary activities, do so.

93.
Set aside as many hours per day as you can spare to practice awareness watching awareness, with no other
activities happening during your practice time.

94.
If the above brief passages (87 - 93) were written on every page, almost no aspirant would ever follow the
advice given.

95.
Why? Because their desire for liberation from the ego
is not great enough.

96.
The desire to preserve the ego is much greater than
the desire to end the ego, and this is true for almost all humans and this is true for almost all spiritual

aspirants.

97.
Thus the ego has trillions of tricks to preserve its
imaginary self.

98.
To the above quoted passages (87 - 93), the aspirant
would say (99 - 103):

99.
“He does not really mean the only effective means”.

100.
“He does not really mean we need to set aside time
with no other activities”.

101.
“He does not really mean we need to practice”.

102.
“The book is actually written in code”.

103.
“There are deeper meanings that are more important”.

104.
If this (99 - 103) seems insane to you, you are correct,
it is insane.

105.
The word “insane” describes well almost all humans.

106.
They may not use those exact words (99 - 103) to
distort and complicate.

107.
They will find their own words and thoughts to distort
and complicate.

108.
The only cure for all this is the awakening of the
extremely intense desire for freedom.

109.
What if your present desire for freedom were to become a million times more intense than it is now?
(110 - 114):

110.
Then there would not be time for all these games,
detours and distractions.

111.
Then you would stop listening to teachers who are
supposedly liberated but who are not liberated.

112.
Then you would not pretend thinking about spirituality
is Spirituality.

113.
Then you would not pretend an intellectual journey is a spiritual journey.

114.
Then the only means you would accept would be the most direct means.

115.
Then you would be just like the man who is being kept
underwater trying to rise up for air (116 - 127):

116.
He does not have time for discussion.

117.
He does not have time for games.

118.
He does not have time for false teachers.

119.
He does not have time for methods that are not the
most rapid and direct means.

120.
He does not have time for endless reading.

121.
He does not have time for television.

122.
He does not have time for projecting an imagined
meaning unto the teachings.

123.
He does not have time for entertainment.

124.
He does not have time for pretending to want to be
free.

125.
He does not have time for any dishonesty with himself.

126.
He does not have time for pretending he has risen to
the surface.

127.
He does not have time for any debate or argument.

128.
What he has time for is only to focus all of his attention
on rising to the surface.

129.
That is why the entire key lies in the intensity of the
desire for freedom.

130.
The only problem an aspirant ever has is too weak a
desire for liberation.

131.
An extremely intense desire for liberation will solve all
the other problems.

Read Chapter Four very slowly three times before reading
Chapter Five.

Chapter 5 - HOW TO AWAKEN THE EXTREMELY INTENSE DESIRE FOR LIBERATION

1. The primary means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation is to carefully examine two choices everyday until the extremely intense desire for
liberation awakens.

2. Choice A is to choose to end the ego by dropping all unnecessary activities, to create the maximum amount of time everyday to practice the most direct and rapid
means to eternal bliss.

3. The most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss, here and now in this lifetime, is the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method described in Chapter Seven.

4. Choice A is Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss with
no sorrow and no suffering.

5. Choice A is Eternal Life.

6. Choice A is to live as your true Self for all eternity.

7. Choice A is absolutely perfect joy.

8. The above (2 - 7) is a summary of Choice A.

9. Some people may find it helpful to read more descriptions of Choice A written by the Awakened Ones who have taught in the past and such quotes or a list
of books will be provided in future volumes of this book or on The Freedom Religion, inc. web site: http://www.thefreedomreligion.com (some of this material
can be seen on pages that are linked on the Awareness Watching
Awareness index page).

10.
Choice B is being identified with a body subject to suffering, sorrow, disease, death, violence, fear, anger,

etc.

11.
Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego to
pretend to be yourself and to control you.

12.
Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego, that has created all the wars, diseases, death, sorrow, suffering and evil that every human has ever
experienced, to continue.

13.
Choice B is to have a temporary and therefore futile life
that leads only to death.

14.
In order to better examine Choice B, you can make a list of all the forms that human sorrow and suffering
take.

15.
You can write on that list thousands of wars, thousands of diseases, thousands of forms of violence and every other form human sorrow and suffering takes that you can think of. Usually humans look only at a small part
of the ocean of human sorrow and suffering. The purpose of the list is to look at the entire ocean of human sorrow and suffering all at once. The purpose of the list is to look at the entire negative side of human life all at one time. (In the future there will be a
sample list on The Freedom Religion website.)

16.
You need only read the suffering list once.

17.
After that, the summary found in Chapter Five should
be enough.

18.
Read Chapter Five everyday, comparing the summary of Choice A and the summary of Choice B, until the
extremely intense desire for liberation awakens in you.

19.
Read Chapter Five everyday comparing the summary of Choice A and the summary of Choice B until you
have made Choice A.

20.
How will you know that the extremely intense desire
for liberation has been awakened?

21.
When you drop all unnecessary activities everyday,
and use all of that free time created to actually practice everyday the most rapid and direct means to eternal

bliss, you will know that the extremely intense desire for liberation has been awakened.

22.
How will you know that you have made Choice A?

23.
When you drop all unnecessary activities everyday, and use all of the free time thus created to actually practice everyday the most rapid and direct means to
eternal bliss, you will know you have made Choice A.

24.
The Awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation, which can also be called “really making
Choice A” is (25 - 55):

25.
It is like a sign stating “NO MORE” that is a million
miles high.

26.
NO MORE to all of the human evils of the past.

27.
NO MORE to all of the horrors the ego has created.

28.
It is like a silent shout saying NO MORE so loud, that if it were given a voice it would shatter the eardrums of
every human on earth.

29.
It is a demand for Truth.

30.
It is the absolute demand for absolute Truth.

31.
It is the absolute demand for the final end of all human
opinions.

32.
It is the absolute demand for absolute goodness.

33.
It is the absolute demand for the final end of the
imposter who is called the ego.

34.
It is the absolute demand for the Direct Experience of
the true Self.

35.
It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of
Truth with a grip so strong, no power can weaken that grip.

36.
It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of the true Self with a grip so strong, nothing is powerful enough to weaken that grip.

37.
The extremely intense desire for liberation is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of the absolute goodness that has never known falsehood with a grip so strong nothing can weaken that grip.

38.
It is like an absolutely immovable “NO” saying no to the trillions of human lies spoken in the past and the
billions of human lies being thought of each day.

39.
It is an absolute “NO” to the trillions of horrors humans have created in the past and the billions of horrors
humans are creating everyday.

40.
It is an absolute demand for the end of all sorrow and
suffering.

41.
It is an absolute demand for perfect
infinite-eternal-love-joy.

42.
It is an absolute demand that the source of all suffering, violence and evil, which is the imposter
called ego, come to a final end.

43.
It is an absolute devotion to the true Self that is the
background of awareness.

44.
That absolute devotion takes the form of turning the attention away from the world, the body, thought, etc.
and towards awareness watching awareness.

45.
The extremely intense desire for liberation is a demand
for Truth that never compromises.

46.
It is a demand for the end of thought.

47.
It is a demand for the Direct Experience of the absolute
Truth.

48.
When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, these demands are directed inwards, not towards
others.

49.
When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises,
one never again bows before any egotistical human.

50.
When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, all obstacles are swept away.

51.
It is absolute dedication and devotion to absolute
Truth.

52.
It is absolute dedication and devotion to knowing the
true Self in Direct Experience.

53.
After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, every moment of one’s life is dedicated to
awakening from the human dream.

54.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, all of the ego’s lies and games are seen for what they are and all of the ego’s lies and games come
to an end.

55.
When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, the nightmare the ego has created is no
longer tolerated.

56.
The ego is the source of all evil.

57.
The ego is insane. This is true for all humans.

58.
To produce so many trillions of horrors, the ego has to
be evil and insane.

59.
Something in you longs for an end to the imposter’s
dream.

60.
Something in you longs for infinite Love.

61.
Something in you longs for the end of all suffering and
sorrow.

62.
Something in you longs for eternal-joy-love.

63.
It is possible to end the ego’s dream and to discover the true Self which is free of all suffering and sorrow
and whose nature is infinite-eternal-love-joy.

64.
It is possible now in this lifetime, while this body is
living.

65.
Co-operate with your Heart.

66.
Stop listening to your ego.

67.
If you turn your attention away from thought and

towards awareness watching awareness and sustain that look for many hours everyday, eventually the ego dream will end and the true Self will be known.

68.
Then all suffering and sorrow ends and what remains is
the eternal perfection of awareness-love-bliss.

69.
Make Choice A.

70.
Make your choice absolute and absolutely immovable.

71.
Make your choice absolutely solid and final.

72.
Your true Self, the background of awareness that is looking through your eyes now, deserves your
attention.

73.
For your entire life, you have been ignoring your true
Self.

74.
Your true Self, the background of awareness, deserves
your love &amp; attention.

75.
Demand sanity.

76.
The human dream is insane.

77.
Demand sanity by waking up from the human dream
into the reality of your own awareness.

78.
Make Choice A by dropping all unnecessary activities to
create more time for spiritual practice.

79.
Make Choice A by dropping all distractions, detours and entertainment to create more time everyday for
spiritual practice.

80.
Make Choice A by making sure your spiritual practice is
the most rapid and direct means to eternal bliss.

81.
The suffering and sorrow that life brings is also a means to awaken the extremely intense desire for
liberation.

82.
Reading Chapter Five everyday is a much easier and more rapid means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation.

Read Chapter Five very slowly at least three times before reading Chapter Six.

Chapter 6
-
THE AWARENESS WATCHING AWARENESS DISCOVERY

1. By the year 2001 the author had been studying the teachings of almost all the various religions and spiritual paths for 27 years, from the bodily age of 15
to 42.

2. He had read more than two thousand spiritual books.

3. He had spent time with many spiritual teachers in
America and India.

4. It was clear that the essence of most of the spiritual
teachings was focusing the attention on the “I AM”.

5. The place where Judaism, Christianity, Islam and
“Hinduism” meet is turning inward and focusing the attention on the “I AM”.

6. The most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss, finding the kingdom within, “Self-realization” etc., is
turning the attention within to focus on the “I AM”.

7. One modern example of this in “Hinduism” is
Nisargadatta Maharaj.

8. Nisargadatta’s Guru told him to pay attention to the “I
AM” to the exclusion of all else.

9. Nisargadatta followed his Guru’s instruction for three
years.

10.
After three years of practicing in his spare time,
Nisargadatta realized his true Self.

11.
Nisargadatta had to work to support his family,
therefore, he could only practice in his spare time.

12.
Nisargadatta used to spend hours each day looking at

the true Self.

13.
Focusing the attention on the I AM, while excluding all else from one’s attention, is an ancient practice in
“Hinduism”.

14.
The importance of looking inward and knowing the “I AM” is found in the Judeo-Christian teachings also (15
- 19):

15.
And God said to Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”. And He said
“Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you”. (Exodus 3:14)

16.
“Be still and know I AM God”. (Psalms 46:10)

17.
The entire book “The Impersonal Life”, a book of
Christian Mysticism, is written around the single sentence “Be still and know I AM God”.

18.
Jesus said “Before Abraham was, I AM”. (John 8:58)

19.
Jesus said “The Kingdom of God is within you”. (Luke
17:21)

20.
Jesus did not say the Kingdom of God will be within
you after your body dies.

21.
Jesus said “is”. “Is” is present tense. “Is” means now.

22.
The Prophet Mohammad said: “He who knows his Self
knows his Lord”.

23.
There are many other spiritual traditions and teachings that have pointed out that focusing the attention on
the I AM is the most direct and rapid means to
freedom.

24.
Another modern example from “Hinduism” is Ramana
Maharshi.

25.
Ramana Maharshi taught for more than 50 years that the only effective means to end the ego and sorrow
and to remain as eternal joy is to focus on the Self, the
I, the I AM.

26.
By the year 2001 the author had attempted to practice the method of focusing the attention on the I AM for 27

years.

27.
The author had made very little progress with that or
any other method.

28.
In December of the author was in Tiruvannamalai India for the purpose of attending the talks of a teacher in
the Ramana Maharshi tradition.

29.
The author was in his room at the Sesha Bhavan guest
house.

30.
The author was thinking about all the possible
meanings of I and I AM and all the possible approaches to I and I AM that he had read over the years.

31.
The I thought, the thought I AM.

32.
The I feeling, the feeling I AM.

33.
The I consciousness, the I AM consciousness.

34.
To think I or I AM.

35.
To feel I or I AM.

36.
To focus the attention on I or I AM.

37.
The number of different combinations of the approaches and the different views of what I or I AM
means.

38.
After 27 years, the author still was not sure what I AM
means in Direct Experience.

39.
The author was wondering if there was some way to solve these questions and to have clarity both in the meaning of I or I AM and what to do with it, focus the
attention, feel, think, or?

40.
The author wanted an understanding that was so clear that there would be nothing vague left, no more
choices left.

41.
The author really wanted to know the answer.

42.
The author was not going to confine the answer to any previous understanding.

43.
The author was willing to have his previous understanding shattered, if need be.

44.
There was a willingness to consider, maybe for the last two and a half decades, the author had not at all
understood what the I AM is and how to focus on it.

45.
It was a willingness to allow all the old views to be
swept away, if need be.

46.
Ramana Maharshi had said that Self-inquiry is more
like feeling than like thought.

47.
Asking “Who am I?” or asking “To whom do these thoughts arise?” are easy instructions to follow as long
as one stays in the realm of thought.

48.
However, when it comes to feeling “Who am I?” or feeling “I AM”, that had always been a bit vague,
because what exactly is the feeling I AM?

49.
How do I know I AM?

50.
Nisargadatta Maharaj and many others had said the I
AM is consciousness.

51.
The author wondered is the “I AM” the I-thought or is
the “I AM” just my present awareness?

52.
The author thought:

53.
If the “I AM” is this present awareness, just the awareness that is now looking at this room, then paying attention to the I AM is just:

My awareness watching my awareness!

54.
This was a revelation!

55.
Instead of having some vague practice where one is told to pay attention to the feeling I AM, without ever being sure exactly what the “I AM” is and feels like, here was an absolutely clear instruction:

My present awareness watching my present awareness.
Awareness watching awareness.

56.
Not some unknown seemingly far away awareness labeled the Infinite Self, or labeled God.

57.
This awareness, my awareness, here and now watching itself, while ignoring thought, the body, and the world,
etc.

58.
Immediately the author tried this practice (59 - 65):

59.
Awareness watching awareness while ignoring thought.

60.
The author shut his eyes, because the point was also
to ignore the world.

61.
To turn the attention that normally goes out to the
world around 180 degrees and to look inward.

62.
To turn the attention away from thought and towards
awareness watching awareness.

63.
If the author noticed a thought, he ignored the thought and brought the attention back to awareness watching
awareness.

64.
Awareness paying attention to awareness to the
exclusion of all else.

65.
Awareness paying attention only to itself.

66.
The results were instant!

67.
From the very first moment one tries this practice, one
is abiding as awareness!

68.
There is no waiting!

69.
It is so easy.

70.
One does not mean to imply that from the beginning
the ego ends.

71.
It takes years of continuous practice before the ego
meets its final end.

72.
However, from the moment one tries this simple, easy
to understand practice, one is abiding as awareness!

73.
The author practiced the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method for two years, from December 2001

of to January of 2004.

74.
There were more days with twelve hours of practice
than there were days with two hours of practice.

75.
In January of 2004 the author’s ego, sorrow and suffering came to its final end and what remained is:

Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss.

76.
Thus the Awareness Watching Awareness Method once again lived up to its reputation as being the most rapid and direct means to eternal bliss here and now in this
lifetime.

77.
Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj had both specifically described the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, however, the author’s ego did not
allow him to see it.

78.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method was like a buried treasure, hidden amongst so many other quotes
on so many different subjects.

79.
Future volumes of this book or the Freedom Religion, inc. website, will present some quotes where the Awareness Watching Awareness Method has been described by Awakened Sages of the past and other quotes that are helpful to spiritual aspirants or that
support the teachings in this book.

80.
All of the spiritual teachings of the past have been distorted and contaminated by the ego, therefore the
present volume has very few quotes.

81.
Another reason the author did not previously realize the true meaning of the “I AM” is because he had read that the I AM, the true Self, is Infinite Continuous
Awareness.

82.
That made it seem like it must be something different
from the awareness that wakes up in the morning.

83.
However, it is due to the habit of always looking outward that the assumption is made that the awareness that wakes up in the morning is limited.

84.
If one observes the awareness for many years eventually one discovers that the awareness is not limited and is continuous.

85.
The significance of the Awareness Watching Awareness
Method discovery is one of communication.

86.
A human could be told to focus on the I AM and even after one hundred million lifetimes still not know what
the I AM is.

87.
However, if told the I AM is the awareness that wakes up in the morning, the background of awareness that is there during all the waking hours, and given specific instructions in how to turn the attention away from thought, etc. and towards awareness watching awareness, one can end the ego, sorrow and suffering
in this lifetime and remain eternally in bliss.

88.
Those specific instructions are found in Chapter Seven.

89.
You might think that the majority of humans would rejoice at the discovery of the most rapid and direct
means to eternal bliss.

90.
Due to the tricks of the ego, the majority of humans
will not rejoice at the discovery.

91.
That is why this book begins by identifying the imposter, exposing the motivations and tricks of the imposter, showing the importance of, and how to
awaken, the extremely intense desire for liberation.

92.
Historically, not even one in a million humans has been dedicated to the Direct Experience of the Eternal Truth
that lives within them and is their true Self.

93.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means for a human to end suffering and to remain in
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss.

94.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the
most rapid and direct means for a person of the Jewish faith to directly experience the I AM that revealed its Self to Moses.

95.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means for a Christian to discover and live in the Kingdom of God within them in Direct Experience in this lifetime.

96.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means for a “Hindu” to attain liberation while living (jivanmukti) and to live in
Being-Awareness-Bliss (sat-chit-ananda).

97.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the
most rapid and direct means for a Muslim to know their true Self. The Prophet Mohammad said: “He who
knows his Self knows his Lord”.

98.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means for a Buddhist to attain Nirvana and to bring the ego, suffering, desire and
craving to its final end.

99.
The ego has distorted all of the religious and spiritual teachings of the past to serve its purpose and to hide
the most rapid and direct means to liberation.

100.
What happens in all of the religious and spiritual teachings of the past is the ego in the reader or listener co-operates with the ego in the so-called spiritual teacher to produce a teaching that will serve
the ego. Then both the teacher and the student call the
false teaching a true teaching.

101.
Some of the spiritual teachings of the past were
authentic spiritual teachings given by awakened sages.

102.
However, the moment an awakened sage speaks the
ego in the listener begins to distort the teachings.

103.
Therefore, the distortion does not take time to begin.
The distortion begins instantly, immediately.

104.
Once the teaching has been distorted by the ego, the
teaching serves the ego.

105.
The ego distortion becomes even greater as time
passes.

106.
It is possible to extract helpful quotes from the

teachings of the past, however, the quotes must be extracted by an awakened sage.

107.
If one in whom the extremely intense desire for liberation has not been awakened attempts to extract quotes, the quotes extracted will usually be those that
serve the ego.

108.
Because it is the most rapid and direct means to end human misery and to live in Peace-joy, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method is of great benefit even to
those who are not spiritually inclined.

109.
What might seem like only a slight difference in the way one practices, makes a huge, profound, extraordinary, quantum leap of a difference in the
speed of the results.

110.
What might seem like only a slight difference in the way one practices, can save years or even lifetimes of
practice.

111.
Therefore, the precision with which the practice
instructions are described is crucial.

112.
A slight change in the wording of the practice instructions will produce a slight change in the practice, thereby making the practice indirect and losing the
rapid results.

113.
There are other methods that appear similar to the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, however, seemingly similar methods will not produce the rapid results and they will not save the years or lifetimes of
practice.

114.
Those other seemingly similar methods have slight
differences that destroy the efficiency.

115.
In the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, no
external teacher is needed.

116.
All that is required is that one has the precise practice
instructions and follows them by practicing.

117.
First the written instructions are the teacher, then the practice itself is the teacher.

118.
The written instructions are only the teacher for the
few minutes it takes you to read them or listen to them if you decide to record them on a tape recorder or CD.

119.
Therefore, it is the Awareness Watching Awareness
practice itself that is the teacher.

120.
You never need to physically see a teacher on this
Direct Path.

121.
Physically seeing a teacher would draw your attention
outward and would be counter productive.

122.
The Awareness Watching Awareness Method practice instructions are offered free and are found in Chapter
Seven.

123.
The only way to find out if the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method works for you is to practice it.

124.
If without trying it, you come to the conclusion that it will not work, then you have allowed the imposter
(thinking) to rob you of a great opportunity.

125.
With thinking you have a conclusion, an opinion, an
assumption that may be correct or may not be correct.

126.
However, with practice, you will know for sure if it
works for you or not.

127.
Therefore, consider giving it a sincere, fair try.

128.
A few months is not long enough to be a sincere, fair
try.

Read Chapter Six very slowly three times before reading
Chapter Seven.

Chapter 7 - THE AWARENESS WATCHING AWARENESS METHOD PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS

PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Set aside as much time everyday to practice the
Awareness Watching Awareness Method as you are willing to set aside.

2. Everyday, drop as many unnecessary activities as you are willing to drop to create more time for the
Awareness Watching Awareness Method practice.

3. If you are not willing to drop all unnecessary activities in order to create the maximum amount of time everyday for practice, then you can read Chapter Five and Chapter Thirteen everyday until the extremely
intense desire for liberation awakens in you.

4. Eating food and taking a shower are examples of
necessary activities.

5. For some people working to earn a living is an example
of a necessary activity.

6. For some people taking care of their children is an
example of a necessary activity.

7. Examples of unnecessary activities are entertainment,
hobbies, etc.

8. Practice for at least two hours everyday.

9. If you are retired and can practice for twelve hours
everyday, that would be much more effective.

10.
It is better if you can be undisturbed during your
practice.

11.
If you practice at home you can ask the people you live

with not to disturb you when you are practicing unless there is an emergency.

12.
Or you can find some other place to practice where you
will be not be disturbed.

13.
Bodily posture is not important in the Awareness
Watching Awareness Method.

14.
However, since one wishes to turn the attention away from the body, it is important that the body is comfortable and relaxed and not causing any pain or
strain.

15.
You can do the practice sitting crossed legged or sitting on a chair or sitting on a sofa or couch or even laying down on your bed if you are able to do so without
falling asleep.

16.
Make sure the posture is comfortable and does not
cause any pain, strain or discomfort.

17.
Make sure the posture helps you to ignore the body
and turn your attention away from the body.

18.
For the purposes of this practice the following definitions for the words awareness and thought must
be used:

19.
Thought (19 - 21): Thoughts are the words of your
native language in your mind.

20.
If your native language is English and the language you think in is English, thoughts are those English
words in your mind.

21.
If you think in two languages, then thoughts are the
words of those two languages in your mind.

22.
Awareness (22 - 46): When you wake up in the morning awareness is that consciousness that woke up
in the morning.

23.
Thoughts come and thoughts go, but the background
of awareness remains continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep at night.

24.
Awareness is you, your awareness, just your

awareness that is looking through your eyes right now.

25.
The words awareness, consciousness, attention, observation, watching, looking, seeing and concentrating all have the same meaning in the
practice instructions.

26.
Awareness is not thought.

27.
Awareness is that which is aware of thought.

28.
Both when there are thoughts and when there are no thoughts, the awareness that woke up in the morning is aware, because the awareness that woke up in the morning is continuous during all of the waking hours
until you go to sleep.

29.
Awareness is not emotions.

30.
Awareness is that which is aware of emotions.

31.
Both when there are emotions and when there are no emotions, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the awareness that woke up in the morning is continuous during all of the waking hours
until you go to sleep again.

32.
Awareness is not the objects seen by the eyes.

33.
Awareness is that which is aware of the objects seen
by the eyes.

34.
The awareness that woke up in the morning is there when the eyes are open seeing objects and when the eyes are closed not seeing objects, because the background of awareness is continuous during all the
waking hours until you go to sleep again.

35.
Awareness is not the thought ‘I’.

36.
Awareness is that which is aware of the thought ‘I’.

37.
Both when one thinks ‘I’ and when one does not think
‘I’, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the background of awareness is continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep again.

38.
Awareness is not desire.

39.
Awareness is that which is aware of desire.

40.
Both when there is desire and when there is no desire, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the background of awareness is continuous
until you go to sleep again.

41.
Awareness is not something far off, lofty or mysterious.

42.
Awareness is that which is looking through your eyes
reading this.

43.
Just your ordinary, everyday awareness.

44.
Not some special awareness.

45.
Awareness is that which wakes up in the morning and
remains aware until you go to sleep at night

46.
Awareness is not any of the things or experiences
perceived.

47.
Try an experiment (48 - 52):

48.
Look at an object in the room.

49.
Notice the awareness that is looking through your
eyes.

50.
Now shut your eyes and notice that you are still aware.

51.
It is the same awareness that a moment ago was
looking at the room.

52.
Now, with your eyes still closed observe your
awareness.

53.
The following practice instructions are the Awareness
Watching Awareness Method described using carefully chosen slightly different wording.

54.
It is important to use as few words as possible to
describe the practice.

55.
Use only one description per practice session.

56.
If you are going to be practicing for one or two or three

hours today, then for that entire time you should be using only one description.

57.
Try Description A first.

58.
Try a different description each day until you have tried
all of them.

59.
Then choose the description that was easiest for you to understand and to practice, and from then on use only
that description.

60.
Some descriptions might for a moment have you start with your eyes open, but once you are instructed to
close your eyes, then keep your eyes closed.

61.
In other words, the Awareness Watching Awareness
Method is always practiced with the eyes closed.

62.
When you are observing your awareness, just remain
with that.

63.
There is no need to do anything else.

64.
Awareness is empty, there is no object you are trying
to observe.

65.
It is just awareness being aware of itself.

66.
It is not a special kind of awareness.

67.
It is just your ordinary everyday awareness that you
normally go through the day with, looking at itself.

68.
You can record the descriptions below on an
audiocassette or CD for personal use.

69.
Record only one description per recording.

70.
It is important to listen to only one description during a
practice session.

71.
It is better not to interrupt your practice session by
having to turn your recording off.

72.
That is why it is best to record only one description per
recording.

73.
Repeat the same description on the recording every 30

minutes.

awareness aware only of awareness. If you notice your breathing, turn your attention away from the breathing and towards awareness aware only of awareness. Whatever you become aware of, turn your attention
away from it and towards awareness of awareness.

98.
Description Y: Shut your eyes. Awareness not aware of thoughts. Awareness not aware of emotions.
Awareness not aware of anything except awareness. Awareness aware of nothing except awareness. The background of awareness aware only of the background of awareness. Awareness aware only of
awareness. Awareness only. Awareness alone.

Read Chapter Seven three times very slowly before reading
Chapter Eight.

Chapter 8 - FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE
AWARENESS WATCHING AWARENESS METHOD

1. These further clarifications appear in a separate chapter because the practice instructions for the Awareness Watching Awareness Method are simple and
they should remain simple.

2. It is not helpful to bring concepts with you into the
practice.

3. It is best just to focus on the simple practice
instructions.

4. One of the things you might wonder is what to do after
you start watching your awareness.

5. There is nothing else to be done.

6. You just continue with awareness watching awareness.

7. There are no objects to see.

8. Awareness is empty, there is no thing to observe
there.

9. Just continue for the entire practice session watching your awareness. Only awareness watching awareness
and nothing else.

10.
Don’t expect any type of experience.

11.
If you are wondering if you will have some kind of spiritual experience, then that very wondering means you have added something to awareness watching
awareness.

12.
Never add anything to awareness watching awareness.

13.
The key is to be content just watching your awareness

and not to move from that and not to add anything to that.

14.
You may or may not have some kind of spiritual experience. However, you should never be expecting
any kind of spiritual experience.

15.
If you wonder if the state is going to deepen, that very wondering means you have added something to the
Awareness Watching Awareness practice.

16.
Never add anything to the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method.

17.
Just be content with awareness watching awareness.

18.
You should look at it like awareness watching
awareness is all there is, there is nothing more.

19.
In the Awareness Watching Awareness Method
practice, you are not seeking anything.

20.
You are observing, not seeking.

21.
If you were seeking something, then there would be
seeking and awareness watching awareness.

22.
That would mean you would have added seeking to the
awareness watching awareness practice.

23.
Never add anything to the awareness watching awareness practice. Just be content to continue with awareness watching awareness without adding
anything to it.

24.
The best practice session is when there are no
thoughts.

25.
If there are thoughts, turn your attention away from the thoughts and towards awareness watching
awareness.

26.
Do not encourage thoughts.

27.
Do not try to complete a thought.

28.
Do not turn your attention towards thoughts.

29.
Do not think about thinking.

30.
If thoughts are happening, do not make a problem out of it. Just turn your attention away from thoughts and
towards awareness watching awareness.

31.
Just remain with awareness watching awareness.

32.
When awareness is watching awareness something
extraordinary is happening.

33.
You are for the first time turning inward.

34.
Your true nature is awareness.

35.
What you really are at your core is awareness.

36.
Therefore, in awareness watching awareness, you are for the first time observing yourself and knowing
yourself.

37.
However, you should not think about that or anything else written in this chapter while practicing awareness watching awareness, because then you would be
adding those thoughts to the practice.

38.
It is being pointed out that you are doing something extraordinary when awareness is watching awareness because at first you might think: “what else?” or “so
what?”.

39.
Just continue to practice and forget about “what else?”
or “so what?”.

40.
Just by turning your attention away from thought and towards awareness watching awareness, you are doing something that will change your life completely if you
are sincere and continue to practice.

41.
Most humans live their entire lives always looking
outward at people, places and things.

42.
By turning your attention away from the world, body and thought, and towards awareness watching
awareness, you are doing something extraordinary.

43.
For some people it might take a few days, others a few weeks and others a few months to start to feel

something.

44.
At first it is subtle and you won’t know what it is, but
you will know that you like it.

45.
It is pleasant.

46.
A new subtle feeling.

47.
You are beginning to feel: eternal life-love-peace.

48.
However, you should not have any expectations about that, because if you expect that, then you are adding that expectation to your awareness watching
awareness practice.

49.
Never add anything to your awareness watching
awareness practice.

50.
Just remain in awareness watching awareness while
ignoring all else.

51.
Just stay there.

52.
Just remain in that.

53.
Don’t look for something else.

54.
While you are practicing the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method (55 - 89):

55.
Just stay there.

56.
Relax with that.

57.
Don’t seek something other than awareness watching
awareness.

58.
Don’t seek any other state.

59.
Don’t seek deeper awareness.

60.
Don’t seek anything.

61.
Just remain in awareness watching awareness.

62.
Be happy that it is simple.

63.
Don’t seek more than that.

64.
It is just a simple state.

65.
Don’t seek peace.

66.
Let peace come on its own if it is going to come,
without your expecting or seeking it.

67.
Just remain with awareness watching awareness, and every time a thought arises, turn your awareness away from the thought and towards awareness watching
awareness.

68.
Just continue to practice everyday.

69.
Look at it as though all you were seeking was the awareness watching awareness itself and not
something else. Therefore, be content with just staying in awareness watching awareness without moving from
it.

70.
Some days the mind may be noisy, but if you keep on practicing, a good day will appear when your practice will go very deep without your trying to make it go
deep.

71.
Never think about deep or not deep.

72.
If you think about deep or not deep you would be adding something to the awareness watching
awareness practice.

73.
Just be content to remain with awareness watching awareness regardless of whether it seems like a good
practice session or not.

74.
Some days your emotions may be turbulent.

75.
Just ignore the turbulent feelings and turn your attention away from the turbulent emotions and
towards awareness watching awareness.

76.
If you continue practicing the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method everyday, eventually you will start to enjoy awareness watching awareness.

77.
How long it will take to begin enjoying awareness watching awareness is different for different people.

78.
For some people it may take days, others weeks and others months.

79.
The point is, if you find it difficult to remain with awareness watching awareness in the beginning, don’t give up, practice everyday on the good days and on
the noisy mind or turbulent feeling days also.

80.
Just continue turning your attention away from
thoughts and towards awareness watching awareness.

81.
You should not be expecting the day when you will
start to enjoy awareness watching awareness, because then you would be adding something to the awareness watching awareness practice in the form of an
expectation.

82.
The best kind of awareness watching awareness
practice is one that is empty.

83.
Just awareness watching awareness and nothing else.

84.
Just stay there.

85.
Just be there.

86.
Just dwell there.

87.
Just remain there.

88.
Don’t seek anything different, just be content with
awareness watching awareness.

89.
Just relax and continue watching your awareness.

90.
Here is a way to look at it:

91.
Awareness watching awareness is a little like falling in
love.

92.
You spend time with someone.

93.
You watch them. You observe them.

94.
But you do not yet know them.

95.
You continue to observe them.

96.
You don’t have expectations, because you don’t know

them well enough yet to have expectations.

97.
You just keep on observing.

98.
Some days you have pleasant feelings while you
observe them.

99.
Some days you have unpleasant feelings while you
observe them.

100.
You continue to observe them.

101.
Everyday you are coming to know them better, even though you may not be aware that you are coming to
know them better.

102.
Then one day suddenly and unexpectedly, you have
fallen in Love.

103.
Awareness watching awareness is a little like that.

104.
Just don’t expect anything, and continue watching your
awareness.

105.
The fact that nothing is happening is great!

106.
If it seems like day after day it is just the same, only
awareness watching awareness, that is great!

107.
Just remain content with that.

108.
If you think it is going to change, then you are adding something to awareness watching awareness, in the
form of an expectation that it is going to change.

109.
Just look at awareness watching awareness as enough,
just as it is.

110.
Continue your practice everyday.

111.
When will you fall in love with awareness watching
awareness?

112.
It may be after one month or after many months of
practice.

113.
You will have plenty of confirmation along the way.

114.
Once you have started to experience even a little joy

or peace from awareness watching awareness, the practice progresses very rapidly after that.

115.
It does not take long to reach the point where just closing your eyes brings awareness-joy to you even
before you have started the practice.

116.
You should not expect it, because then you have added something to the Awareness Watching Awareness
Method.

117.
Some people might not like the practice for the first
week or two.

118.
Just persevere and keep practicing.

119.
You can look upon your awareness as something that wants you to watch it without expecting anything from it, like someone who wants to be loved just for what
they are and not for what they can give you.

120.
Just continue to watch awareness, and don’t be
expecting peace-love-joy.

121.
Let peace-love-joy come on its own, without your
expecting it.

122.
What you truly are is:
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Bliss-Love.

123.
However, by having your attention turned towards the world, the body and thought all the time, you imagine
you are a body subject to disease, death and suffering.

124.
By turning your attention towards awareness, you are
for the first time observing what you are.

125.
When you practice, do not think about what you are.

126.
Just watch your awareness without expecting anything.

127.
Don’t watch your thoughts.

128.
Turn your attention away from your thoughts and
watch your empty awareness.

129.
Observe the observing.

130.
Observe the awareness.

131.
If you remain content with just awareness watching awareness, eventually your problems will start to
disappear.

132.
Your misery will start to disappear.

133.
Peace will come unexpectedly.

134.
Joy will come unexpectedly.

135.
Infinite Love will come unexpectedly.

136.
Awareness watching awareness is awareness being
awareness.

137.
Because of the long ancient habit of looking outward towards people, places and things, the word “watching”
is used in some of the practice instructions.

138.
One takes that same habit of watching people, places, and things and shuts the eyes and turns it inwards
towards awareness watching awareness.

139.
That is why the word watching is used in some of the
practice instructions.

140.
What is real is awareness watching awareness, looking
inward.

141.
What is unreal is looking outward towards the world of
people, places and things.

142.
Looking outward brings suffering, death and futility.

143.
Watching thoughts is not looking inward.

144.
Watching feelings is not looking inward.

145.
Watching breathing is not looking inward.

146.
Only turning the attention away from the observed and
towards the observer is looking inward.

147.
Only awareness watching awareness is looking inward.

148.
Looking inward is liberation.

149.
Looking inward is eternal life.

150.
Looking inward is eternal awareness.

151.
Looking inward is eternal peace.

152.
Looking inward is eternal joy.

153.
Looking inward is eternal Love that is absolutely
perfect and free of all forms of sorrow and misery.

154.
That joy, that perfection is your awareness.

155.
Because you always looked outward, you never
experienced it.

156.
To change this long habit of looking outward you need
to practice everyday.

157.
Spend as many hours everyday practicing as you can.

158.
If you only practice awareness watching awareness for
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very quickly.

159.
If you want rapid results, drop all your unnecessary activities to create the maximum amount of time you can spare to practice for many hours per day,
everyday.

160.
Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can devote the whole day (8 to 12 hours) to
practicing the Awareness Watching Awareness Method.

161.
To come to know, experience and live in
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss is definitely worth the time spent practicing.

162.
You will discover you are not a body living in a world.

163.
You are eternal awareness, perfect love-joy.

164.
Remember to be content with just awareness watching
awareness.

165.
Don’t expect any of the experiences described in this chapter. Expectation will destroy the effectiveness of

the practice.

166.
If it seems boring the first few times you try the awareness watching awareness practice, that is OK.
Continue to practice.

Read Chapter Eight very slowly three times before reading
Chapter Nine.

Chapter 9 - THE ABANDON RELEASE METHOD

1. If your ego will not allow you to practice the Awareness
Watching Awareness Method, the Abandon Release
Method is the second best choice.

2. The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is more
effective than the Abandon Release Method.

3. Therefore, if your ego will allow you to practice it, the
Awareness Watching Awareness Method should be your first choice.

4. If one looks at the thousands of spiritual practices that have been taught to humans in the past, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means to bringing sorrow, suffering and the ego to its final end, here and now in this
lifetime.

5. The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means to living in
infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss here and now in
this lifetime.

6. If one looks at the thousands of spiritual practices that have been taught to humans in the past, the Abandon Release Method is the second most rapid means to bringing sorrow, suffering and the ego to its final end
here and now in this lifetime.

7. If one looks at the thousands of spiritual practices that have been taught to humans in the past, the Abandon Release Method is the second most rapid means to living in infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss, here and
now in this lifetime.

8. The Abandon Release Method is easier to practice than the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, even when you are tired or sleepy.

9. If your ego will not allow you to practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, you could practice the Abandon Release Method for one year and then try switching to the Awareness Watching Awareness Method and then remaining with the Awareness Watching Awareness Method.

10.
Or you could continue practicing the Abandon Release
Method for as many years as you wish to practice it.

11.
You should practice one or the other, the Awareness
Watching Awareness Method or the Abandon Release
Method, for the rest of your life.

12.
The reason practice should continue for as long as the
body lives is (13 - 16):

13.
There is a false state of liberation, where the ego has not come to its final end, but has only been temporarily submerged consciously in the infinite
awareness.

14.
This temporary state is very similar to liberation, there is no sorrow and no suffering and one only has the
experience of infinite awareness love bliss.

15.
One in this temporary state will usually have the
perception that they have been liberated.

16.
However, one in this temporary state has not been
liberated.

17.
That (13 - 16) is the reason that one should practice for as long as the body lives, even if one has the
perception that one has been liberated.

18.
The preliminary instructions for the Abandon Release
Method are the same as the preliminary instructions for the Awareness Watching Awareness Method.

19.
See Chapter Seven for the preliminary instructions.

20.
In the beginning, the best position for practice of the
Abandon Release Method is laying down on your bed.

21.
After you have practiced the Abandon Release Method many times, then you could try the practice sitting up.

22.
After you have practiced the Abandon Release Method many times in both positions, sitting up and laying down, you can choose the position you like best and continue to practice in that position.

23.
The following is a suggested schedule for using the
Descriptions (39 - 44 in the Practice Instructions below) :

24.
Start by using the Description D practice instructions
for the first month.

25.
Use Description E for the second month.

26.
Use Description A for the third month.

27.
Use Description B for the fourth month.

28.
Use Description A (again) for the fifth month.

29.
Begin using Description C and continue with it for one
to four years.

30.
Once per month, as a reminder, for one practice
session, use description A.

31.
After one to four years of practice, you may be so familiar with the practice, that Description F is all you
need.

32.
Like any skill, the more you practice, the more skill you
gain.

33.
The longer you practice the more enjoyable the practice becomes, after you have gained some skill in
letting go.

34.
Some people will find the Abandon Release Method
practice enjoyable from the beginning.

35.
Other people will find the practice easy and enjoyable
only after many weeks of practicing everyday.

36.
You can make a recording of the practice instructions
(Descriptions A, B, C, D, E or F) on an audio cassette
or CD and then play them during your practice session, repeating the instructions on the recording after 30 minutes. Pause for one minute between each sentence

when making the recording.

37.
Put the “do not disturb” sign on your bedroom door,
turn out the lights, lay down on your bed.

38.
If laying down flat on your back becomes tiresome at
some point, you can turn over on your side.

THE ABANDON RELEASE METHOD PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS

39.
Description A: Shut your eyes. Relax your body. Now ignore your body. Let go of all effort. Let go of all sense of having to do something, as though there is nothing you have to do and nothing you have to think

Read Chapter Nine three times very slowly before reading
Chapter Ten.

Chapter 10 - THE ETERNAL METHOD

1. The purpose of the Eternal Method is to provide a
sense of the limitless nature of eternal life.

2. Any position is OK for this practice.

3. Laying down on your bed with the lights turned off is
the best position.

4. If you record the instructions, pause for one minute
between each sentence.

5. The Eternal Method is not an essential method and, therefore, the Eternal Method should not be practiced
more often than once per month.

THE ETERNAL METHOD PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS

6. Shut your eyes.

7. Imagine you are traveling back in time.

8. Go back in time one hundred billion years.

9. Now go back in time one hundred billion more years.

Now travel back eight hundred trillion years further into the past.

15.
Imagine that you are traveling at the rate of eight hundred trillion years per second into the past and that you have now traveled for one hundred trillion years at that rate.

16.
You are now in a time that is before anything that existed in the universe at the time you lived on earth
came into being.

17.
None of the stars or planets that existed at the time you lived on earth exist yet, because you are now in a
time before they existed.

18.
Travel eight hundred trillion years further back in time.

19.
Realize now that no matter how long you continue to travel back in time you will not have come any closer to the eternal past because the eternal past goes on
forever.

20.
Now travel another eight hundred trillion years further
into the past.

21.
Now imagine you have traveled another eight hundred
trillion years into the past.

22.
Now travel another eight hundred trillion years further
into the past.

23.
Realize that no matter how long you continue to travel into the past, even if you travel at the rate of eight hundred trillion years per second for a hundred trillion years, you will not come closer to the eternal past because the eternal past means always was, on and on
forever.

24.
Now look into the eternal past and reflect on the
meaning of “always was”.

25.
The objects in space come and go, however, the space
is eternal.

26.
Reflect on the meaning of “the eternal past”.

27.
Reflect on the meaning of “the eternal past goes on
forever and ever”.

Now come back to the present time.

34.
Imagine you are traveling forward in time.

35.
Travel one hundred billion years into the future.

36.
Now travel one hundred billion years further into the
future.

37.
You are now so far into the future the earth and the
earth’s sun no longer exist.

38.
Now travel one trillion years further into the future.

39.
Now imagine that you have traveled one trillion more
years into the future.

40.
Now travel eight hundred trillion years further into the
future.

41.
Now imagine that you have traveled another eight
hundred trillion years further into the future.

42.
Imagine that you are traveling at the rate of eight hundred trillion years per second into the future and that you have traveled for one hundred trillion years at
that rate.

43.
You are now in a time when everything that existed during the time when you lived on earth is now no
longer existing.

44.
All of the stars and planets that existed at the time when you lived on earth, no longer exist.

45.
Look at how all of the things that you thought were so important when you lived on earth have no importance now.

46.
Look at how all of the problems you thought you had
when living on earth have no significance now.

47.
Look at how all those problems you had when you lived on earth really did not have any real significance when you lived on earth. You only imagined those problems
had significance.

48.
What has real value and significance is that which is
eternal.

49.
The eternal infinite space-awareness, that is eternal life, is what you are and what you always have been and that is where all real significance, truth, meaning,
perfect safety, bliss and love are.

50.
Now imagine you have traveled another eight hundred
trillion years further into the future.

51.
Now travel another eight hundred trillion years into the
future.

52.
Realize now that no matter how long you continue to travel into the future, you will not have come any closer to the eternal future, because the eternal future
goes on forever.

53.
Now travel another eight hundred trillion years further
into the future.

54.
Now imagine you have traveled another eight hundred
trillion years into the future.

55.
Realize that no matter how long you continue to travel into the future, even if you travel at the rate of eight hundred trillion years per second for one hundred trillion years, you will not come closer to the eternal future, because the eternal future means always will
be, on and on forever.

56.
Now look into the eternal future and reflect on the meaning of “always will be”.

57.
The objects in space come and go, however, the space is eternal.

58.
Reflect on the meaning of: “the eternal future”.

of “no end”.

62.
Reflect on the meaning of: “the eternal future has no
end”.

63.
Look into the eternal future and see the meaning of
“the eternal future goes on forever and never ends”.

64.
You are that eternal infinite space-awareness that
never ends.

65.
See the beauty of eternal life.

66.
Come back to the present time and dedicate every moment of your life to the realization of the Direct
Experience of who you really are at your core.

67.
In your daily life, don’t let the imposter, the mistaken identity, take you through distractions, detours and activities that lead to the temporary and therefore, to
that which is meaningless.

68.
Drop all distractions, detours, entertainment and pointless useless activities, to create the maximum amount of time for the practice of the most rapid and
direct means to eternal bliss.

69.
Never waste time.

70.
Never waste even one second.

71.
Discover your eternal life in Direct Experience.

72.
Discover who you really are at the core of your being.

73.
Discover who you really are at the core of your

consciousness.

74.
The core of your consciousness is infinite and eternal.

75.
A wave on an ocean of consciousness imagines there is
a bottom line.

76.
One day the wave challenges that assumption by
diving deep down.

77.
The wave discovers there never was any bottom line.

78.
The wave discovers there are no waves, there is only
the ocean.

You are: infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss.

80.
Realize who you are in Direct Experience.

81.
Bring the imposter self to an end.

Chapter 11 - THE INFINITE SPACE METHOD

1. When people practice the Awareness Watching
Awareness Method, they often tend to have the perception that awareness is something in their head.

2. Your awareness is not in your head.

3. Your awareness is infinite.

4. The Infinite Space Method helps to remove the
perception that awareness is something in your head.

5. The Infinite Space Method helps to provide a sense of
the limitless nature of infinite space.

6. The Infinite Space Method is not an essential method, therefore, the Infinite Space Method should not be
practiced more often than once per month.

7. You can practice the Infinite Space Method in any position, however, for the first time, try practicing
laying down on your bed with the lights turned off.

8. If you record the instructions, pause for one minute between each sentence.

ends.

same direction.

eternal-infinite-space-awareness-love-bliss.

60.
All the boundaries are imagined.

61.
There are no real boundaries.

62.
In Reality there is only the infinite freedom of infinite
space.

63.
From time to time in your daily life, focus on the space
instead of on the objects.

64.
Space inside the objects, space outside the objects,
and space in the imagined boundary.

been eternal-life-love-awareness-joy.

81.

in practice to wake up.

83.
You are not a thinker living in a body in a world.

84.
You are: infinite-eternal-space-awareness-love-joy.

32.

FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE LOVING ALL METHOD

33.
If you don’t understand how to practice the above instructions using the word “love”, you can substitute the words “emotionally allow” for the word “love” in the
above instructions.

34.
After practicing everyday for one month using the words “emotionally allow”, you can substitute the words “emotionally accept” for the word “love” in the
above instructions.

35.
After practicing everyday for one month using the words “emotionally accept”, you can go back to the original wording of the instructions, just as they are, using the word “love”, and then continue using the
word love from then on.

36.
The Loving All Method refers only to your emotions.

37.
No changes in your external behavior are required.

38.
For example: if a vase falls and you would normally try and catch it, you will also try and catch the vase while
you are practicing the Loving All Method.

39.
You do not allow the vase to fall because you are
loving the falling.

40.
If someone were to try to punch you in the face and if you would normally duck, you will also duck while
practicing the Loving All Method.

41.
The fact that you are loving the fact that someone is
trying to punch you does not mean you will not duck.

42.
You also love the fact that you are ducking to avoid being punched.

43.
The Loving All Method is about emotional acceptance.

44.
The Loving All Method is not about changing your
actions.

45.
Like any skill, the more you practice, the more skill you
gain.

46.
If someone says something mean to you and if you feel bad emotionally because of what they said, then love your negative emotion and love yourself for having the
negative emotion.

47.
In the beginning, even though you are attempting to love everything and every experience exactly the way
it is, you probably will not succeed in loving everything
and every experience exactly the way it is.

48.
Changing the long time habit of emotionally rejecting
experiences will require lots of practice.

49.
Love as much as you can love.

50.
Keep practicing everyday trying to love everything
exactly the way it is.

51.
As the months go by, you will gain more success at loving more and more experiences exactly the way
they are.

52.
It might take some years of practice for you to be able
to love everything exactly the way it is.

53.
Everyday, try to love everything and every experience
that happens, exactly the way it is.

54.
Loving everything the way it is includes emotional
acceptance.

55.
Emotional acceptance does not prevent you from trying
to change whatever you wish to change.

56.
What you wish to change, you will still change.

57.
Whatever action you would normally take to change
something, you will still take that same action.

58.
In the beginning, even though you are trying to love

everything you experience, you might only be able to love a small part of what you experience.

59.
Everyday that you practice the Loving All Method, you will gain more skill at being able to love everything you
experience, exactly the way it is.

60.
You should not try to look inward while engaged in
daily activities.

61.
You should look outward while engaged in daily
activities.

62.
In other words, it is important to pay attention to what
you are doing while engaged in daily activities.

63.
The Loving All Method is not a “looking inward”
method.

64.
It is important to pay close attention to what you are doing during your daily activities so that your activities
flow smoothly.

65.
If you were to try to look inward during your daily
activities, your activities may not flow smoothly.

66.
For example: if you try to look inward while putting toothpaste on your toothbrush, you might put shampoo or shaving cream on your toothbrush instead of toothpaste, because of having your attention divided
between outward and inward.

67.
Fortunately, the Loving All Method does not require
inward attention.

68.
The Loving All Method does not require thought either.

69.
The Loving All Method is developing a new feeling
habit.

70.
The Loving All Method is developing the habit of feeling
love towards everything you perceive.

71.
In the beginning you could try practicing “no emotional
resistance” during all of your daily activities.

72.
In action you can resist all you want to resist.

73.
If you would normally resist something in action, you will continue to resist something in action while practicing the Loving All Method.

74.
Not resisting emotionally has nothing to do with what
you do in your actions, activities and behavior.

75.
You can continue to resist all you wish to resist in your actions, activities and behavior while practicing the
Loving All Method.

76.
While you may be resisting in action, you do not resist
emotionally while practicing the Loving All Method.

Read Chapter Twelve three times very slowly before reading
Chapter Thirteen.

Chapter 13 - THE REMINDERS

1. Read Chapter Five and Chapter Thirteen everyday until
the extremely intense desire for liberation awakens.

2. You will know the extremely intense desire for liberation has awakened when you have dropped all unnecessary activities to create the maximum amount
of time for spiritual practice.

3. If you do not do your spiritual practice everyday, eventually, sooner or later, your life will become full of
suffering.

4. If you do not do your spiritual practice everyday, eventually, sooner or later, one or more of the thousands of different types of sorrow and suffering
will enter your life.

5. If you do not do your spiritual practice everyday, you will continue to be caught in the cycle of birth and death, birth again, death again, birth again, death
again and in that cycle, eventually, all of the thousands
of forms that suffering takes will enter your life.

6. If you do not do your spiritual practice everyday, you will experience death, diseases, violence and thousands of other types of suffering, lifetime after
lifetime.

7. If you do your spiritual practice everyday, for the maximum amount of time you can create by dropping all unnecessary activities, eventually all forms of suffering will end and you will live in:
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss.

8. The purpose of spiritual practice is to experience Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss in this lifetime, not in the afterlife or some future lifetime.

9. All delays are tricks of the ego.

10.
All detours are tricks of the imposter self.

11.
All distractions are tricks of the false pretend self.

12.
Every thought that leads you away from spiritual
practice is a trick created by the imposter.

13.
Look at your daily activities and drop all those activities that are not necessary, to create the most time you
can create for spiritual practice everyday.

14.
Taking a shower and eating food everyday is
necessary.

15.
For most people working to earn a living everyday is
necessary.

16.
Entertainment is not necessary.

17.
Make sure that the spiritual practice you are doing IS
the most rapid means to
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss.

18.
You have a choice between CHOICE A (19 - 21):

19.
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss with zero
suffering.

20.
Absolutely perfect Love-Bliss for all eternity.

21.
Living in and knowing your true Self.

22.
Or CHOICE B (23 - 26):

23.
Thousands of forms of suffering, sorrow, violence, disease and death, over and over again,
death-rebirth-death-rebirth.

24.
Living from and knowing an imposter self.

25.
Living from an acquired false self in the form of
thought.

26.
Living from a parasite that pretends to be your self.

27.
Make CHOICE A.

28.
Every day that you do your spiritual practice, you are making CHOICE A.

29.
Every day that you do not do your spiritual practice,
you are making Choice B.

30.
Read Chapter Thirteen everyday.

31.
The pretend self is very tricky and tries to lead people
away from spiritual practice.

32.
Reading Chapter Thirteen everyday will help to combat
the ego’s tricks.

33.
Everyday look at your activities and drop all activities
that are not really necessary.

34.
Everyday create as much time as possible for spiritual
practice.

35.
Do your spiritual practice everyday.

36.
Everyday you have a CHOICE.

37.
You cannot do anything about yesterday’s choices,
therefore, do not worry about yesterday’s choices.

38.
What you can do is: Do your spiritual practice
today.

39.
Before the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, the false self will lead you to a practice that
will promote more egotism.

40.
After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be lead to the spiritual practice that is the most rapid means to:
Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss.

41.
After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be able to see how the pretend self has contaminated all of the spiritual teachings of the
past.

42.
Reading Chapter Five and Chapter Thirteen everyday may be enough to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation in you.

43.
Self-honesty is a great help towards the awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation.

44.
Watch the ego when it tries to lead you away from spiritual practice into distractions, detours, diversions, delays, unnecessary activities and entertainment, but
do not let the ego win that battle.

45.
Time is precious.

46.
Do not waste time in activities that lead only to that
which is temporary and therefore futile.

47.
Ask of each activity: “Where can this lead?”

48.
Ask of each activity: “Can this lead to eternal bliss, or
does this just lead to that which is temporary?”

49.
There are thousands of quotes from the spiritual teachings of the past that support the teachings in the
book you are now reading.

50.
However, the time you spend in practice is a trillion
times more beneficial than the time you spend reading.

51.
Therefore, if you are willing to practice, practice.

52.
If you are not willing to practice even after reading Chapter Five and Chapter Thirteen hundreds of times, then you could try reading some quotes or books by other authors. For recommendations on where to read the most powerful spiritual teachings, see future volumes of this book or thefreedomreligion.com
website.

53.
Choose the Direct Experience of
infinite-eternal-existence-being-life, here and now in this lifetime, by making it the first priority in your life and by centering your entire life around your spiritual practice.

54.
Choose the Direct Experience of
infinite-eternal-awareness, here and now in this lifetime, by making it the first priority in your life and by centering your entire life around your spiritual practice.

55.
Choose the Direct Experience of infinite-eternal-bliss, here and now in this lifetime, by making it the first priority in your life and by centering your entire life around your spiritual practice.

56.
Choose the Direct Experience of infinite-eternal-love, here and now in this lifetime, by making it the first priority in your life and by centering your entire life
around your spiritual practice.
