  This tale directly inspired the creation of "Necronomicon" by H. P. Lovecraft so now you can hear where the inspiration for Necronomicon came from. This tale is a part of the "The King in Yellow" series. "The King in Yellow" is a cursed book which opens the gateway to the other world. Lovecraft was inspired by this series and later on, created his much more sinister cursed book, Necronomicon. Lovecraft even used some references of this book in "The Whisperer in Darkness." If you enjoy Necronomicon and H. P. Lovecraft, You don't want to miss this. Enjoy!
