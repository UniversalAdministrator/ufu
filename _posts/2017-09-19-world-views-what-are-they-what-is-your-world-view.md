Religion, Politics, Aesthetics, Methods, Future, Ethics, Epistemology,
and Metaphysics (Ontology, Cosmology, etc). We ALL hold to varying
versions of these eight philosophies - whether we are aware of it or not.

<h1>Definition of World View</h1>
A world view is the foundational belief system upon which one’s entire understanding of the “big picture” of all existence, and the more immediate “small picture” one’s personal existence, is based.

 	<li>It is the answer to “why” things happen, exist (or don’t exist)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">

</ol>
<h2>What is Your World View and How Do You Determine It?:</h2>
EVERYONE has a world view, but not everyone is aware of the one they hold. We all operate by a set of governing rules that we believe at our deepest core to be the “best” set for us. Some of us might claim to be pacifists in our praxeology yet when we are wronged, the first thing we seek to do is “fight” (either verbally, psychologically, or physically) to defend our position or worse, to “even” the score. This would demonstrate that we “think” we’re pacifists but our actions i.e. where the “rubber hits the road” would demonstrate that we more “passive aggressive” than “pacifist”. Because we might have conflicting ideas about what our worldview might be, I’ve begun to construct a list below of categories and subclasses that I would like someday to transform into a “worldview test”
<h2>Philosophy: Philos (loving) Sophia (wisdom/knowledge)</h2>
• <em>Prov 4:5-7 Get wisdom (Chokmah)! Get understanding (biynah)! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth. Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love “ ‘ahab” (philos) her, and she will keep you. Wisdom is the principal thing; Therefore get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding.
</em>
We are all philosophers, old and young, its just a matter of what our “personal philosophy” is i.e. our “worldview”. We are a reasoning and thinking species. It is this very ability to “reason” that secular scientists and thinkers feel, separates us from the animals.

We are complex and unique creatures and our view of the world can be equally complex and unique as well. Although there are 7 basic, but universal philosophical disciplines which provide a framework for a person’s worldview, many of philosophies of one particular category may overlap into a category of another. i.e. Postmodernism is both a methodological and an epistemological approach to one's view of the world. I've listed the 7 major categories below with many (not all) of the philosophical approaches, traditions, and disciplines as they apply to that component of one's overall world view:
<h2>Philosophy of Religion - Who or what is the supreme authority in the Universe?</h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Some common world views pertaining to the philosophy of religion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Theism - belief in the existence of a god or gods, usually belief in one god in the monotheistic sense or one overall god of which all are a part as in the pantheistic sense. God as creator of the universe, intervening in it (monotheistic) and sustaining a personal relation to his creatures. (monotheistic)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Monotheism - The belief in a singular omnipotent God - i.e. Christians, Judaism, Islam</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Deism - belief in the existence of a supreme being, specifically of a creator who does not personally interact in His universe. Deism was birthed and reached its zenith during an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that accepted the existence of a creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind. The god of deism has often been referred to as the “Watchmaker god” in that he creates a machine i.e. the universe, and simply lets it wind down of its own accord. Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were said to have been deists, however, a closer examination of their actual writings reveals a belief in a Deity that is personal and “providential” (supernaturally intervening) in the affairs of His creation. Their writing more closely resemble the God of Judaeo-Christianity than that of the deists of their day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Polytheism - The belief in and worship of more than one god. This often applies differing attributes to a multiplicity of gods who are usually at odds with one another such as in Greek, Roman, or Near Eastern mythology. Most all of polytheism was wiped out in the west with the arrival of Christianity and in the East with the arrival of Islam.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Pantheism - The theistic belief that all beings in the universe (including the universe itself) comprise the being known as “god” such as in Brahman of Hinduism. This is often confused with Panentheism which is actually a differing belief that all things and the universe are in god. A misnomer about pantheism is that it is a theology that permits or tolerates all gods. This is decidedly false in that the exclusive God of Christianity and the exclusive god of Islam are both said to be “accepted” but the claims of exclusivity by both gods are utterly rejected. That is to say, Pantheism is inclusive of all religious systems except true Christianity and true Islam</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Agnosticism - The belief with regards to all religion and/or supernatural that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God. There are usually two subtypes of agnostics: hard skeptics which claim that if there is a god nothing can ever be known about Him in that He is “wholly other” - that is, knowledge of god is impossible. The other variety of skeptic is considered a “soft” skeptic which claims that if there is a God - we probably couldn’t know or have knowledge of him, i.e. knowledge of god while not impossible, it is improbable</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Atheism - A (without) theism (belief in God). Essentially a belief system of faith unto itself whereby the assertion is held that God does not exist.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Nihilism - One of two definitions pertaining to nihilism. This one pertaining to philosophy of religion whereby all religious and moral principles are rejected due to the fact that life is meaningless</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Relativism - a belief system that stretches across epistemology, ethics/morality, and religion which holds to the idea that absolutes do not exist in the realms of knowledge, morality, and truth but rather exist only in direct relation to the culture, history, and society in which they are encountered. The flaw of this belief system is that it requires “absolute” knowledge and truth to claim there is “no absolute” truth or knowledge regarding religion etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Solipsism - A somewhat obscure and simple system of belief that by its very simplicity affects nearly every category of one’s world view that adheres to it. Solipsism is simply the belief that nothing can be known outside of one’s self. In fact nothing can be known to even exist outside of one’s self. Because of its odd simplicity I have placed it in a number of categories. In this case, with regards to religion, it is similar to the hard agnostic view that knowledge of God cannot be known, obviously because he would exist outside of one’s self.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Asceticism - An approach to religion whereby the comforts and amenities of this world are typically viewed as “excess” and therefore evil. The response is usually a separatist and or monastic lifestyle to scorn the pleasures of this world in order to gain a greater appreciation for the spiritual pleasures and disciplines. Buddhist monks and medieval Christian monks are an example of the ascetic lifestyle. Because this comprises a methodology to material life, and a motivation with view to ethics and morality, it is also a sub-category of the praxeology/methodolgy and the ethics/morality world view categories as well</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Philosophy of Politics - How should people be governed?</h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Some common world views and ideologies pertaining to the philosophy of politics:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Socialism - A philosophy or system of governance whereby production, distribution, and large scale commerce are either owned or highly regulated by government which is comprised of officials that are put in place via a limited election process. Adherents and the system’s founder, Karl Marx, define it as governing by the community as a whole, although it rarely works out this way. In most socialist governments in the world today, an even smaller few rule over an even greater majority than in a true democracy or representative republic. Marx believed socialism to be a transitional social state between capitalism and communism. Along with communism and fascism, socialism is one of three primary forms of collectivism.<em>Other names associated with socialism are leftists, nanny state, progressivism, social democracy, communism, marxism, labor, entitlement state</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Communism - a political system of governance founded by Karl Marx whereby all property is “public-owned” which translates to “government-owned” which then equates to the public having little to do whatsoever with property, commerce, or distribution whatsoever. Each citizen works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. Normally, communism attempts to overthrow existing governmental infrastructures by way of class warfare, pitting the lower and middle classes of a society against the higher or highest classes (i.e. the ones with power and influence). i.e. 99% vs the 1%. This results in animosity and if successful, a violent coup or takeover via populist-leaning political powers. Unfortunately, history has shown us that the corruption at the heart of mankind results in a government which filters and skims most of the “public” proceeds leaving a society overcrowded, cramped into multi family living quarters, hungry, and destitute of purpose. This is a far more “hardline” approach to “community ownership” and governance than that of its little sister socialism. Along with facism and socialism, communism is one of three primary forms of collectivism.Communists are often referred to as <em>leftist, liberal, progressive, radicals, sometimes mistakenly referred to as “socialists”</em></li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Fascism - A method of governing whereby social organization is achieved via nationalism and enthusiastic support of a central charismatic leader. It has, in the past, exalted a particular race or nation over others as in the case with Germany in 1932-1944, but this is more an exception than the rule. Usually it is a party-led fight for national prominence and growth via a centralized and autocratic leader. c.f. Venezuela, and some Central African nations. Like communism, this system involves stringent social regimentation for the “better of the state” and usually there is a high level of suppression of opposition which preserves the fascist government’s control of the populace. This method of governance is often used synonymously with the term “<em>dictatorship</em>” or "totalitarianism". Along with communism and socialism, it is one of three primary forms of collectivism.The argument for this position of governance is the absence (usually) of red tape and bureaucracies which have been known to delay major national decisions. The problem is that reform is usually impossible outside of removing the fascist in power. (Most dictators don't see a need to reform themselves just everyone else)</li>

 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Anarchism - The political philosophy which contends that all governmental authority is useless and undesirable. The anarchist opts instead for a voluntary community of cooperation, affiliation, and association of societal groups and individual citizens</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Autocracy - One person with absolute and unchallenged authority. Often used synonymously with fascism, despotism, totalitarianism etc. The current political environment in post-communist Russia would greatly resemble an autocratic governance with Putin acting as an unchallenged authority, arresting and oppressing opposition</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Nepotism - Although most commonly used today in the context of employment, this can be considered a method of governance within a given government infrastructure. It is the practice of appointing favorites, usually relatives, to ideal positions primarily based on kinship as opposed to qualification. This was a fairly common practice within the hierarchy of the the Catholic Church whereby Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops would appoint their relatives to church positions. Today the political practice is most evident in American politics with the President appointing key positions within a Representative Republic to family and friends. i.e. President John Kennedy appointing his brother Robert to Attorney General, etc.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Hegemony - The political approach whereby a dominance of one social, economic, political, ideological, or cultural group is exerted over all others. i.e. There is a decided liberal hegemony within the university hiring system, etc. Democracies, Republics, Socialist, and Communist nations all have a level of hegemony, no political system is immune to this approach.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Oligarchy - A system of governance where a small exerts control over the larger community (the tail wags the dog) usually in a manner that serves corrupt or self-serving goals. i.e. The lobbyists in Washington D.C. exercise a great deal of control over the U.S. Senate which in turn exercises a great deal of control over the United States.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Capitalism - Primarily an economic system that calls for private and corporate ownership of all capital goods. It is driven by the free market system whereby competition determines the economic success and failure of the individual and the corporation. It is extolled by conservatives as providing an opportunity to everyone willing to work to improve their standard of living and achieve financial success by ingenuity. It is condemned by liberals, socialists, and communists who echo the 150 year old attitude of Karl Marx who paints capitalism as “unbridled greed” and “oppressive of the proletariat”.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Conservatism - One of the most ill-defined political philosophies in the world today. Often times referred to as “preferring an existing or traditional situation” which is incorrect. Conservatism is a political philosophy which calls for small or highly limited government and free market system which establishes the best product or service at the best price due to healthy competition within the marketplace. Conservatism condemns the high taxes required by progressive or liberal political system which fund big government. Socially, conservatism tends toward a more Judaeo-Christian moral structure with approach to governance versus the Darwinian humanist social emphasis of progressives and liberal social governance. Referred to as “rightist” or “conservative right” on the political spectrum.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Liberalism - Widely considered “leftist” on the political spectrum with a decided socialist or communist approach to governance in its call for big government or total government involvement or ‘regulation’ in the lives of its citizenry. The liberal’s (recently adopted moniker “progressives” to shed the negative connotation with the term “liberal”) approach to economic governance is in keeping with Karl Marx, the founder of communism, in that liberals condemn free market capitalism as the height of greed and source of all social and economic woes (c.f. Michael Moore documentaries, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Hollywood methodology in general). To this end, liberalism calls for a highly regulated economy by the government and high taxes to fund that resulting mammoth government. A common holding of all taxes, land, and goods which are then redistributed by this government are said by liberals to solve the social and economic woes of society. Most recently liberalism in Washington D.C. and the mainstream media hired a number of ‘protestors for pay’ to simulate a grass roots movement called “Occupy Wall Street”. Ultimately employing class warfare to promote the views of liberalism. Socially, liberalism is Darwinian and humanist in its approach, which randomly borrows ethics and morals from the Judaeo-Christian worldview, without adhering to the Deity which claims to be the source of those ethics and morals.</li>

<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Centrism - The political position of the moderate whereby radical change of the left (liberal) or the right (conservative) is scorned for a more "please everyone" approach to political reform by employing a gradual change and repeated compromise in policy. "He who stands for everything - stands for nothing" and "You can please some of the people some of the time but you can never please all of the people all of the time." are both famous credos of centrist opposition. In social matters, the moderate tends to lean to the left and in economics to the right, somewhat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Pacifism - The position whereby resistance to government or authority is scorned in an effort to "pacify" those in power and maintain the status quo. This attitude is found in those who call themselves "liberal, moderate, or conservative" yet refuse to vote - which belies the underlying political philosophy of pacifism. Many who scorn participation in the affairs of governance (politics) can usually be identified with pacifistic tendencies. This is more often used in modern vernacular as a descriptor of a praxeology or methodology than a political philosophy or world view in that it usually pertains to someone who is in direct opposition to military conflict of any sort usually due to moral objections or religious convictions i.e. Amish, Mennonites, and Transcendentalists, are usually pacifists.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Democracy - A system of government whereby the power resides in the hands of the people by way of majority vote. Democracies exert their governmental power through frequent general and free elections. This can be accomplished at times with limited administrative representation but in a genuine democracy, the people vote on all public policy, social machinations, military, foreign relations, taxation, and economic policy are all set by a vote of the people in conjunction with the administration of elected officials. This 'purist' form of democracy today only exists in concept only and is referred to sometimes as "Direct Democracy" and as such does not currently exist among first or second world nations (second world meaning "limited industrialization, etc.". Many Representative and Social Republics today are mistaken for democracies and have even coined the term "preserving the world for democracy" even while those governments are not democracies themselves.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Republic - A form of governance modeled after ancient Greek and Roman governments circa1st-2nd century B.C. This government infrastructure consists of a hierarchy of elected officials who act as "representatives" acting on behalf of their constituencies (ideally) in casting votes which form public policy, social machinations, military, foreign relations, taxation, and economic policies, etc. Policies such as 2, 4, and 6 year terms and overall term limits are put in place to prevent an imbalance of power. Because these officials are put in place by public vote, this system of government is often confused with a democracy and like a democracy, there are loopholes for abuse whereby votes by the elected officials are manipulated special interest groups, lobbyists, and outright bribery. (c.f. United States "Obamacare" kickback scandals). Abuses like this result in representatives voting according to their own interests when it comes to taxation and military action and not necessarily the "will" of their constituents. As evidence that corruption is so rampant in this system of governance, candidates will raise hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars or pounds to get themselves elected to the position of congressman, parliamentarian, or senator while the position itself only pays a middle class wage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Laissez-Faire - This is more a "creed" against government interference in public and economic policy beyond the bare minimum to protect and maintain geo-political peace (secure national borders) and the personal property of the individual. Because of this, military action outside the role of national protection is usually condemned by a laissez-faire doctrine.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>LIbertarianism - This is the extreme embodiment of laissez-faire as a governmental system. Although there is a more strict condemnation of military action than the typical laissez-faire creed calls for, libertarianism maintains a very similar set of ideals with regards to individual rights and freedoms while condemning a "big government" or "big brother" state.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Imperialism - A nearly extinct system of governance whereby a particular government seeks to expand its own influence and power usually by military action or "strong-handed" foreign policy. Soviet Russia accused the United States of this policy repeatedly during the cold war years (1947-1987). Whereas Soviet Russia expanded its territory by way of military action (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan) and heavy-handed foreign policy (overuse of veto or "Nyet!" during U.N. General Counsel sessions) during this period than any other nation on earth. Nazi Germany was a perfect example of Imperialism during the events that led up to World War II. Whereas the United States and Great Britain have had a history of imperialism during the 20th century, the political philosophy seems to be a dying albatross in light of today's emphasis on globalism</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Globalism - The prevailing political attitude of the 21st century whereby the interests of the world as a whole overrule the interests of a particular nation or individual. The early attempts at globalism include the failed "League of Nations" which was an international organizational response to the nationalism and arms race that was said to have brought on World War I. It failed due to existing national exceptionalism found in the world powers of that day: England, France etc. The second attempt at globalism was the formation of the United Nations after World War II. This institution has been largely ineffective at carrying out true globalist policy in that it has historically relied on the U.S. military to provide a 'bite' to its international bureaucratic 'bark'. Today we see INTERPOL and cap and trade carbon tax policies that seek to undermine and overthrow existing nationalism and national exceptionalism. This has led to establishing environmental, economic, and social policy along with military action determined by a globalist political world view.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Nationalism - The political mindset that holds one particular nation superior to all other nations with regards to culture, heritage, interests, methodology, and an overall way of life. i.e. American exceptionalism. With the rise of Globalism, nationalism has quickly been regarded as misplaced and misguided enthusiasm by a fanatical few. c.f. American mainstream media's approach to the grassroots Tea Party movement. Nationalism has seen a sharp decline in the west but seems to be on the rise in some of the newer first world nations like Brazil and China.</li>

<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Monarchy - A method of governance defined by the absolute sovereignty of a single individual. Usually this chief of state either establishes a hereditary line or is a part of an already-established hereditary line of monarchs. The UK is considered a "monarchy" but the role of royalty in state affairs is primarily determined by a parliament and the Prime Minister. The UK more resembles a form of a socialist republic than it does a monarchy in the 21st century. Many third world and some second world nations still have established monarchies.</li>

 	<li>Egalitarianism - The political position that declares that all citizens are of total equality, especially with regards to political, economic, and social policies and interests. It is most common among socialist and communist ideologies - although it is rarely practiced among such governments. i.e France, Cuba, Italy, Great Britain, China, North Korea. Australia seems to operate primarily by an egalitarian political world view today.</li>

It is for this reason that traditional medical aid (doctors) are rejected. c.f. Church of Scientology</li>

Some early strands of Gnosticism might be considered nihilist in approach in that the material is an illusion and only the spiritual is real. Some Chinese traditional religions are somewhat nihilist in a metaphysical sense by way of denying that the pleasures of this life are an illusion and must be disregarded. i.e. Taoism.</li>

<h1>Test To Determine Your Worldview:</h1>
The following test is a general guide to helping us examine and ultimately define the world view we already hold. It will eventually be an automated results test but for now it is completed via manual entry.

The test is phrased with the pronoun “we” which applies to the human race in general. The idea is for us to think in generalities to determine our view of the world, how it works, how it applies to us, the people in it, and how we relate to them, and they to us. Obviously, there are no wrong answers and similar to an enneagram test, the more honest you are, the more accurate the results. Also, our world view can change over time.

<h2>Philosophy of Religion - Who or what is the supreme authority in the Universe?</h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Some common world views pertaining to the philosophy of religion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Theism - belief in the existence of a god or gods, usually belief in one god in the monotheistic sense or one overall god of which all are a part as in the pantheistic sense. God as creator of the universe, intervening in it (monotheistic) and sustaining a personal relation to his creatures. (monotheistic)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Monotheism - The belief in a singular omnipotent God - i.e. Christians, Judaism, Islam</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Deism - belief in the existence of a supreme being, specifically of a creator who does not personally interact in His universe. Deism was birthed and reached its zenith during an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that accepted the existence of a creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind. The god of deism has often been referred to as the “Watchmaker god” in that he creates a machine i.e. the universe, and simply lets it wind down of its own accord. Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were said to have been deists, however, a closer examination of their actual writings reveals a belief in a Deity that is personal and “providential” (supernaturally intervening) in the affairs of His creation. Their writing more closely resemble the God of Judaeo-Christianity than that of the deists of their day.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Polytheism - The belief in and worship of more than one god. This often applies differing attributes to a multiplicity of gods who are usually at odds with one another such as in Greek, Roman, or Near Eastern mythology. Most all of polytheism was wiped out in the west with the arrival of Christianity and in the East with the arrival of Islam.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Pantheism - The theistic belief that all beings in the universe (including the universe itself) comprise the being known as “god” such as in Brahman of Hinduism. This is often confused with Panentheism which is actually a differing belief that all things and the universe are in god. A misnomer about pantheism is that it is a theology that permits or tolerates all gods. This is decidedly false in that the exclusive God of Christianity and the exclusive god of Islam are both said to be “accepted” but the claims of exclusivity by both gods are utterly rejected. That is to say, Pantheism is inclusive of all religious systems except true Christianity and true Islam</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Agnosticism - The belief with regards to all religion and/or supernatural that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God. There are usually two subtypes of agnostics: hard skeptics which claim that if there is a god nothing can ever be known about Him in that He is “wholly other” - that is, knowledge of god is impossible. The other variety of skeptic is considered a “soft” skeptic which claims that if there is a God - we probably couldn’t know or have knowledge of him, i.e. knowledge of god while not impossible, it is improbable</li>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Atheism - A (without) theism (belief in God). Essentially a belief system of faith unto itself whereby the assertion is held that God does not exist.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Nihilism - One of two definitions pertaining to nihilism. This one pertaining to philosophy of religion whereby all religious and moral principles are rejected due to the fact that life is meaningless</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Relativism - a belief system that stretches across epistemology, ethics/morality, and religion which holds to the idea that absolutes do not exist in the realms of knowledge, morality, and truth but rather exist only in direct relation to the culture, history, and society in which they are encountered. The flaw of this belief system is that it requires “absolute” knowledge and truth to claim there is “no absolute” truth or knowledge regarding religion etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Solipsism - A somewhat obscure and simple system of belief that by its very simplicity affects nearly every category of one’s world view that adheres to it. Solipsism is simply the belief that nothing can be known outside of one’s self. In fact nothing can be known to even exist outside of one’s self. Because of its odd simplicity I have placed it in a number of categories. In this case, with regards to religion, it is similar to the hard agnostic view that knowledge of God cannot be known, obviously because he would exist outside of one’s self.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Asceticism - An approach to religion whereby the comforts and amenities of this world are typically viewed as “excess” and therefore evil. The response is usually a separatist and or monastic lifestyle to scorn the pleasures of this world in order to gain a greater appreciation for the spiritual pleasures and disciplines. Buddhist monks and medieval Christian monks are an example of the ascetic lifestyle. Because this comprises a methodology to material life, and a motivation with view to ethics and morality, it is also a sub-category of the praxeology/methodolgy and the ethics/morality world view categories as well</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Philosophy of Politics - How should people be governed?</h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Some common world views and ideologies pertaining to the philosophy of politics:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Socialism - A philosophy or system of governance whereby production, distribution, and large scale commerce are either owned or highly regulated by government which is comprised of officials that are put in place via a limited election process. Adherents and the system’s founder, Karl Marx, define it as governing by the community as a whole, although it rarely works out this way. In most socialist governments in the world today, an even smaller few rule over an even greater majority than in a true democracy or representative republic. Marx believed socialism to be a transitional social state between capitalism and communism. Along with communism and fascism, socialism is one of three primary forms of collectivism.<em>Other names associated with socialism are leftists, nanny state, progressivism, social democracy, communism, marxism, labor, entitlement state</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Communism - a political system of governance founded by Karl Marx whereby all property is “public-owned” which translates to “government-owned” which then equates to the public having little to do whatsoever with property, commerce, or distribution whatsoever. Each citizen works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. Normally, communism attempts to overthrow existing governmental infrastructures by way of class warfare, pitting the lower and middle classes of a society against the higher or highest classes (i.e. the ones with power and influence). i.e. 99% vs the 1%. This results in animosity and if successful, a violent coup or takeover via populist-leaning political powers. Unfortunately, history has shown us that the corruption at the heart of mankind results in a government which filters and skims most of the “public” proceeds leaving a society overcrowded, cramped into multi family living quarters, hungry, and destitute of purpose. This is a far more “hardline” approach to “community ownership” and governance than that of its little sister socialism. Along with facism and socialism, communism is one of three primary forms of collectivism.Communists are often referred to as <em>leftist, liberal, progressive, radicals, sometimes mistakenly referred to as “socialists”</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Fascism - A method of governing whereby social organization is achieved via nationalism and enthusiastic support of a central charismatic leader. It has, in the past, exalted a particular race or nation over others as in the case with Germany in 1932-1944, but this is more an exception than the rule. Usually it is a party-led fight for national prominence and growth via a centralized and autocratic leader. c.f. Venezuela, and some Central African nations. Like communism, this system involves stringent social regimentation for the “better of the state” and usually there is a high level of suppression of opposition which preserves the fascist government’s control of the populace. This method of governance is often used synonymously with the term “<em>dictatorship</em>” or "totalitarianism". Along with communism and socialism, it is one of three primary forms of collectivism.The argument for this position of governance is the absence (usually) of red tape and bureaucracies which have been known to delay major national decisions. The problem is that reform is usually impossible outside of removing the fascist in power. (Most dictators don't see a need to reform themselves just everyone else)</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Anarchism - The political philosophy which contends that all governmental authority is useless and undesirable. The anarchist opts instead for a voluntary community of cooperation, affiliation, and association of societal groups and individual citizens</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Autocracy - One person with absolute and unchallenged authority. Often used synonymously with fascism, despotism, totalitarianism etc. The current political environment in post-communist Russia would greatly resemble an autocratic governance with Putin acting as an unchallenged authority, arresting and oppressing opposition</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Nepotism - Although most commonly used today in the context of employment, this can be considered a method of governance within a given government infrastructure. It is the practice of appointing favorites, usually relatives, to ideal positions primarily based on kinship as opposed to qualification. This was a fairly common practice within the hierarchy of the the Catholic Church whereby Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops would appoint their relatives to church positions. Today the political practice is most evident in American politics with the President appointing key positions within a Representative Republic to family and friends. i.e. President John Kennedy appointing his brother Robert to Attorney General, etc.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Hegemony - The political approach whereby a dominance of one social, economic, political, ideological, or cultural group is exerted over all others. i.e. There is a decided liberal hegemony within the university hiring system, etc. Democracies, Republics, Socialist, and Communist nations all have a level of hegemony, no political system is immune to this approach.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Oligarchy - A system of governance where a small exerts control over the larger community (the tail wags the dog) usually in a manner that serves corrupt or self-serving goals. i.e. The lobbyists in Washington D.C. exercise a great deal of control over the U.S. Senate which in turn exercises a great deal of control over the United States.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Capitalism - Primarily an economic system that calls for private and corporate ownership of all capital goods. It is driven by the free market system whereby competition determines the economic success and failure of the individual and the corporation. It is extolled by conservatives as providing an opportunity to everyone willing to work to improve their standard of living and achieve financial success by ingenuity. It is condemned by liberals, socialists, and communists who echo the 150 year old attitude of Karl Marx who paints capitalism as “unbridled greed” and “oppressive of the proletariat”.</li>

 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Conservatism - One of the most ill-defined political philosophies in the world today. Often times referred to as “preferring an existing or traditional situation” which is incorrect. Conservatism is a political philosophy which calls for small or highly limited government and free market system which establishes the best product or service at the best price due to healthy competition within the marketplace. Conservatism condemns the high taxes required by progressive or liberal political system which fund big government. Socially, conservatism tends toward a more Judaeo-Christian moral structure with approach to governance versus the Darwinian humanist social emphasis of progressives and liberal social governance. Referred to as “rightist” or “conservative right” on the political spectrum.</li>

 	<li>Liberalism - Widely considered “leftist” on the political spectrum with a decided socialist or communist approach to governance in its call for big government or total government involvement or ‘regulation’ in the lives of its citizenry. The liberal’s (recently adopted moniker “progressives” to shed the negative connotation with the term “liberal”) approach to economic governance is in keeping with Karl Marx, the founder of communism, in that liberals condemn free market capitalism as the height of greed and source of all social and economic woes (c.f. Michael Moore documentaries, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Hollywood methodology in general). To this end, liberalism calls for a highly regulated economy by the government and high taxes to fund that resulting mammoth government. A common holding of all taxes, land, and goods which are then redistributed by this government are said by liberals to solve the social and economic woes of society. Most recently liberalism in Washington D.C. and the mainstream media hired a number of ‘protestors for pay’ to simulate a grass roots movement called “Occupy Wall Street”. Ultimately employing class warfare to promote the views of liberalism. Socially, liberalism is Darwinian and humanist in its approach, which randomly borrows ethics and morals from the Judaeo-Christian worldview, without adhering to the Deity which claims to be the source of those ethics and morals.</li>

 	<li>Centrism - The political position of the moderate whereby radical change of the left (liberal) or the right (conservative) is scorned for a more "please everyone" approach to political reform by employing a gradual change and repeated compromise in policy. "He who stands for everything - stands for nothing" and "You can please some of the people some of the time but you can never please all of the people all of the time." are both famous credos of centrist opposition. In social matters, the moderate tends to lean to the left and in economics to the right, somewhat.</li>

<ol>
 	<li>Pacifism - The position whereby resistance to government or authority is scorned in an effort to "pacify" those in power and maintain the status quo. This attitude is found in those who call themselves "liberal, moderate, or conservative" yet refuse to vote - which belies the underlying political philosophy of pacifism. Many who scorn participation in the affairs of governance (politics) can usually be identified with pacifistic tendencies. This is more often used in modern vernacular as a descriptor of a praxeology or methodology than a political philosophy or world view in that it usually pertains to someone who is in direct opposition to military conflict of any sort usually due to moral objections or religious convictions i.e. Amish, Mennonites, and Transcendentalists, are usually pacifists.</li>

 	<li>Democracy - A system of government whereby the power resides in the hands of the people by way of majority vote. Democracies exert their governmental power through frequent general and free elections. This can be accomplished at times with limited administrative representation but in a genuine democracy, the people vote on all public policy, social machinations, military, foreign relations, taxation, and economic policy are all set by a vote of the people in conjunction with the administration of elected officials. This 'purist' form of democracy today only exists in concept only and is referred to sometimes as "Direct Democracy" and as such does not currently exist among first or second world nations (second world meaning "limited industrialization, etc.". Many Representative and Social Republics today are mistaken for democracies and have even coined the term "preserving the world for democracy" even while those governments are not democracies themselves.</li>

<ol>
 	<li>Republic - A form of governance modeled after ancient Greek and Roman governments circa1st-2nd century B.C. This government infrastructure consists of a hierarchy of elected officials who act as "representatives" acting on behalf of their constituencies (ideally) in casting votes which form public policy, social machinations, military, foreign relations, taxation, and economic policies, etc. Policies such as 2, 4, and 6 year terms and overall term limits are put in place to prevent an imbalance of power. Because these officials are put in place by public vote, this system of government is often confused with a democracy and like a democracy, there are loopholes for abuse whereby votes by the elected officials are manipulated special interest groups, lobbyists, and outright bribery. (c.f. United States "Obamacare" kickback scandals). Abuses like this result in representatives voting according to their own interests when it comes to taxation and military action and not necessarily the "will" of their constituents. As evidence that corruption is so rampant in this system of governance, candidates will raise hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars or pounds to get themselves elected to the position of congressman, parliamentarian, or senator while the position itself only pays a middle class wage.</li>

 	<li>Laissez-Faire - This is more a "creed" against government interference in public and economic policy beyond the bare minimum to protect and maintain geo-political peace (secure national borders) and the personal property of the individual. Because of this, military action outside the role of national protection is usually condemned by a laissez-faire doctrine.</li>

 	<li>LIbertarianism - This is the extreme embodiment of laissez-faire as a governmental system. Although there is a more strict condemnation of military action than the typical laissez-faire creed calls for, libertarianism maintains a very similar set of ideals with regards to individual rights and freedoms while condemning a "big government" or "big brother" state.</li>

 	<li>Imperialism - A nearly extinct system of governance whereby a particular government seeks to expand its own influence and power usually by military action or "strong-handed" foreign policy. Soviet Russia accused the United States of this policy repeatedly during the cold war years (1947-1987). Whereas Soviet Russia expanded its territory by way of military action (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan) and heavy-handed foreign policy (overuse of veto or "Nyet!" during U.N. General Counsel sessions) during this period than any other nation on earth. Nazi Germany was a perfect example of Imperialism during the events that led up to World War II. Whereas the United States and Great Britain have had a history of imperialism during the 20th century, the political philosophy seems to be a dying albatross in light of today's emphasis on globalism</li>

 	<li>Globalism - The prevailing political attitude of the 21st century whereby the interests of the world as a whole overrule the interests of a particular nation or individual. The early attempts at globalism include the failed "League of Nations" which was an international organizational response to the nationalism and arms race that was said to have brought on World War I. It failed due to existing national exceptionalism found in the world powers of that day: England, France etc. The second attempt at globalism was the formation of the United Nations after World War II. This institution has been largely ineffective at carrying out true globalist policy in that it has historically relied on the U.S. military to provide a 'bite' to its international bureaucratic 'bark'. Today we see INTERPOL and cap and trade carbon tax policies that seek to undermine and overthrow existing nationalism and national exceptionalism. This has led to establishing environmental, economic, and social policy along with military action determined by a globalist political world view.</li>

 	<li>Nationalism - The political mindset that holds one particular nation superior to all other nations with regards to culture, heritage, interests, methodology, and an overall way of life. i.e. American exceptionalism. With the rise of Globalism, nationalism has quickly been regarded as misplaced and misguided enthusiasm by a fanatical few. c.f. American mainstream media's approach to the grassroots Tea Party movement. Nationalism has seen a sharp decline in the west but seems to be on the rise in some of the newer first world nations like Brazil and China.</li>

 	<li>Monarchy - A method of governance defined by the absolute sovereignty of a single individual. Usually this chief of state either establishes a hereditary line or is a part of an already-established hereditary line of monarchs. The UK is considered a "monarchy" but the role of royalty in state affairs is primarily determined by a parliament and the Prime Minister. The UK more resembles a form of a socialist republic than it does a monarchy in the 21st century. Many third world and some second world nations still have established monarchies.</li>

 	<li>Egalitarianism - The political position that declares that all citizens are of total equality, especially with regards to political, economic, and social policies and interests. It is most common among socialist and communist ideologies - although it is rarely practiced among such governments. i.e France, Cuba, Italy, Great Britain, China, North Korea. Australia seems to operate primarily by an egalitarian political world view today.</li>

 	<li>Nihilism - The second definition of nihilism in this case is a sub-category of epistemology in the sense that it asserts that nothing in the world has a real existence. Christian Science holds a nihilistic view with regards to sin, sickness, and pain. They assert that these things do not exist but are a figment of the imagination. It is for this reason that traditional medical aid (doctors) are rejected. c.f. Church of Scientology</li>

Some early strands of Gnosticism might be considered nihilist in approach in that the material is an illusion and only the spiritual is real. Some Chinese traditional religions are somewhat nihilist in a metaphysical sense by way of denying that the pleasures of this life are an illusion and must be disregarded. i.e. Taoism.</li>

Good happens to people because of the grace of God. We believe that every good thing proceeds from “Father of Lights”. Personal comfort and happiness are wholly separate things from “good”. Sometimes a thing can be ‘good’ for us but yet “uncomfortable” or even “painful”. At other times a thing that is evil can be quite “comfortable” and “feel good” to a Christian even though it is overtly or covertly harmful to another individual. Christians are careful to keep the concept of “good” separate from the concepts of “personal comfort and happiness”. We believe that “bad things” happen sometimes as a result of a person’s choices but at other times as a result of living in a world that is “fallen” which means that it is not functioning according to the original plan of God and as a result of the original sin of Adam, sickness, pain, suffering, and death were all introduced to a perfect environment and perpetuate until the time that they are ultimately dealt with by His Son Jesus.

Why is there evil in the world and how does it get solved? The presence of evil is as a result of the events described above, also as a result of an enemy described to us by the Holy Spirit (in the Bible) as the ‘accuser’ satan, ‘slanderer’ the devil, or the enemy of our souls that accuses us night and day to God. All sources of evil: Satan, the Fallen World, and man’s fleshly nature, will be dealt with at the second coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. There is no contradiction (as is supposed by the atheist) of the simultaneous existence of an “All loving God” who would want to do away with evil, an “All Powerful God” who could do away with evil, and the presence of evil. What the atheist has failed to grasp is the understanding that an all-powerful, all-loving God may have already chosen to deal with evil over a specified time. And the current temporary existence of evil is actually serving a higher purpose in God’s plan.

A Christian does good things for people because the God that created us has done great things for us. He loved us while we didn’t care about (or even hated) Him. The Eternal Son suffered and died to pay the eternal cost of our sins against the Eternal Father. He then asks of us to love one another as He has loved us. To love those that hate us and spitefully use us. Loving them involves doing good for them. We do bad things on occasion because God tells us that we still have the task of putting to death our “old sin nature” which “grows corrupt”. This is a contention that will continue throughout the Christian’s life. He or she is not perfect, but are being perfected and with maturity, the acts of “badness” will decrease (hopefully sooner than later).

We believe what we hear if it is from the perspective of a person who sees man as the center of the universe and not God. If it is from a Theist perspective, it is rejected outright because religion is detrimental to human advancement. We do not believe everything we see in that many supposed eyewitnesses to “miracles” are nothing more than optical illusions, yet-unexplained phenomena, or worse, the deception of a charlatan. (However, we still claim that the Christian god is false because we can’t see him or have not seen him. We’re funny that way)

Religion and unseen deities are nothing more than a crutch for the weak.

To this God we Christians pray and trust in during great distress. We do not adhere to the heresy that all of our problems will instantly disappear, they may not at all, however, we join our voices to the three young men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who, under great distress, proclaimed, “Our God is able to deliver us, and even if He does not i.e. chooses not to, still we will praise Him.” and again with the ancient sage Job we cry, “Though He slay me, still I will praise Him”. Because a Christian does not base their view of the world and God in light of their circumstances, rather, we view our world and its circumstances in light of our God.</div>
