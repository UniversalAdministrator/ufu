post_title: '[Aleister Crowley-Inspired Occult Fiction] The Magician () by Maugham'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Somerset Maugham met Crowley in Paris and inspired by the event and wrote this book. The occultist / magician of this book 'Oliver Haddo' was modeled after Crowley and his magical activities.
  So this is a fascinating book that offers a window to the occult/magic scene of  early 20th century.
  Also many occult books (allegedly) used as source material (that was the accusation of Crowley regarding the book) including 'Kabbalah Unveiled by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth', 'The Life of Paracelsus by Franz Hartmann' and 'Rituel et Dogme de la Haute Magie by Eliphas Levi.'
