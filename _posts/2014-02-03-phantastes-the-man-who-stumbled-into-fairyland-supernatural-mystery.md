  Phantastes; The Man Who Stumbled Into
  Fairyland, Supernatural, Mystery,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  A fairly normal man stumbles into Fairyland, where his travels acquaint him with longing, fear, strife, endurance, exaltation, humiliation, and grief, in exaggerated form, before disappointment leads him back to the mundane world. Yes, fairies are real, although not even in Fairyland does everyone believe in them. They are quite as real as flowers, equally fragile too—and equally alien to man. And yet, the visitor to their world sheds tears for the affairs of this life, reflected in vivid color in every aspect of that alternative universe. The path through enchantment passes by extravagant beauty under very dark skies. (Summary by Thomas Copeland)
  Phantastes; The Man Who Stumbled Into Fairyland, Supernatural, Fantasy, Audiobook, by George MacDonald.
