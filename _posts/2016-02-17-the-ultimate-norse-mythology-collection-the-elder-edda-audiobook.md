<p>(The main text starts at 29:08 mark and please scroll down on Description page for "time mark" for each sections.) This is the single most important book on Norse Mythology where all the legends and tales of the Norse and also Norse inspired-European tales were originated from. If you like Norse mythology or fantasy tales, this is THE ONE that you don't want to miss! Even relatively modern writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien received most of their inspiration from this book. The very genre of fantasy literature can be considered as an offspring of this book. Each section is an epic mythological poem that can be enjoyed separately so I added time mark for each poem for easy navigation on this epic mental journey into the Norse! (The tales were collected by Sæmund Sigfusson and translated by Olive Bray)
