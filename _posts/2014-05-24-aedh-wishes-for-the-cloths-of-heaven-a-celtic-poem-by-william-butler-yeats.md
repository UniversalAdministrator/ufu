  Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven, a
  Celtic Poem by William Butler Yeats,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
  Enwrought with golden and silver light,
  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
  Of night and light and the half light,
  I would spread the cloths under your feet:
  But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
  I have spread my dreams under your feet;
  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
