post_title: '[Kybalion Study-Aid Occult Lecture] Mastery of Self from 5 Perspective,'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Many requested study-aid for Kybalion and this upload is my answer. Kybalion requires basic level mastery of self and this epic lecture covers all the 5 aspects of self, step by step. (The most important part of this lecture is the last section 'The True Self' and it starts at 7:08:28 mark.)
  Therefore if you master this lecture, you will be fully prepared for the implementation of Kybalion, although this lecture does not directly address Kybalion.
  And if you want to listen to the essence of this lecture first, go to  7:08:28 mark.
  But I highly recommend to go through the entire lecture because the task of self-mastery requires all-around understanding of self and its various aspects.
