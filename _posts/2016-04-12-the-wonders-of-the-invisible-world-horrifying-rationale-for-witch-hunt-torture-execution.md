post_excerpt: |
  The main text starts at 15:04 mark. This is one of the most horrifying books you will ever read. In this book, you'll see the perspective of fundamental-religious fanatics on their quest to torture and burn people in the name of their religion. This book was designed to make an excuse of the atrocity done in Salem witch hunt by the powers that be during that time and you'll see why it is never a good idea to give the political/judicial power to religious fundamentalists.
