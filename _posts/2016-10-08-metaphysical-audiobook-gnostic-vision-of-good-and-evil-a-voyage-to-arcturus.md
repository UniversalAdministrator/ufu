post_title: '(Metaphysical Audiobook) [Gnostic Vision of Good and Evil] A Voyage to Arcturus'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Gnostic visions of the nature of good and evil, metaphysics combined with philosophy, questions on the meaning of life and all of these themes unfolding themselves in a multi-layered fantastic story line and that's why this book is the greatest fiction of the 20th century according to Colin Wilson (I believe most of you are familiar with him given the nature of his writings). Also other seminal figures praised this book very highly including, J. R. R. Tolkien and Clive Barker. Seriously, You don't want to miss this one. Enjoy!
