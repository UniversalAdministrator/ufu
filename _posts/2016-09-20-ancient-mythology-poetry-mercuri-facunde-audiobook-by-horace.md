post_excerpt: |
  Grandson of Atlas, wise of tongue,
  O Mercury, whose wit could tame
  Man's savage youth by power of song
  And plastic game!
  Thee sing I, herald of the sky,
  Who gav'st the lyre its music sweet,
  Hiding whate'er might please thine eye
  In frolic cheat.
  See, threatening thee, poor guileless child,
  Apollo claims, in angry tone,
  His cattle;--all at once he smiled,
  His quiver gone.
  Strong in thy guidance, Hector's sire
  Escaped the Atridae, pass'd between
  Thessalian tents and warders' fire,
  Of all unseen.
  Thou lay'st unspotted souls to rest;
  Thy golden rod pale spectres know;
  Blest power! by all thy brethren blest,
  Above, below!
  ---- End ----
  From the collection "The Odes and Carmen Saeculare"
