  Escape (by Aldous Huxley) Poetry
  Audiobook
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  I seek the quietude of stones
  Or of great oxen, dewlap-deep
  In meadows of lush grass, where sleep
  Drifts, tufted, on the air or drones
  On flowery traffic. Sleep atones
  For sin, comforting eyes that weep.
  O'er me, Lethean darkness, creep
  Unfelt as tides through dead men's bones!
  In that metallic sea of hair,
  Fragrance! I come to drown despair
  Of wings in dark forgetfulness.
  No love ... Love is self-known, aspires
  To heights unearthly. I ask less,—
  Sleep born of satisfied desires.

On flowery traffic. Sleep atones
For sin, comforting eyes that weep.

Unfelt as tides through dead men's bones!

Of wings in dark forgetfulness.
No love ... Love is self-known, aspires
