post_title: '[How to Train Your Mind to Enter the Mental Bliss] The Shining Gateway, Self-Mastery and Development'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  The first chapter might seem bland without that much substance but it gets very interesting from the chapter 2 (starts at 12:39  mark ) and if you never meditated before, it offers a lot of great methodological insights of the mind-mechanism that can be witnessed during the meditation as well. If you are interested in experiencing the bliss using the mind (without any drugs), this book will be a great listen.
