<p>The first chapter might seem bland without that much substance but it gets very interesting from the chapter 2 (starts at 12:39  mark ) and if you never meditated before, it offers a lot of great methodological insights of the mind-mechanism that can be witnessed during the meditation as well. If you are interested in experiencing the bliss using the mind (without any drugs), this book will be a great listen.
