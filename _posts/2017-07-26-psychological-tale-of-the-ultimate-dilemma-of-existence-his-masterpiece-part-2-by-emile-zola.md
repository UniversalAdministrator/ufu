<p>Warning! If you want to listen to something cheerful or pleasant, you should stop right here since this book is one of the most crushingly depressing and agonizing tales I have ever come across. But if you like moody and psychological tales of human agony of existence without any candy-coating, you might enjoy this book greatly.
