<p>Don't let the beginning of this book fool you! At first, it seems like a normal story about Catholic faith but soon after, it begins its rocket ride into a bottomless abyss! This book is considered as 'THE Gothic fiction" among all the Gothic fictions. 
[The Ultimate Gothic Macabre] The Monk, Part 1 (a Tale of Black Magic, Devil, Madness, Taboos, etc.) by Matthew Lewis</p>
