<p>More and more knowledge of occult, alchemy, hermeticism and timeless spiritual wisdom are available nowadays. But it becomes clear that the real problem is not the lack of knowledge but our mental/spiritual dishonesty and laziness. In other words, many do not apply the spiritual wisdom they obtained to their awareness in a genuine manner. These wisdom are ageless and timeless yet without proper integration with one's own consciousness and life, they are not really useful. The master occult scholar Manly P. Hall shares his insight on this issue for us who are willing to listen.
