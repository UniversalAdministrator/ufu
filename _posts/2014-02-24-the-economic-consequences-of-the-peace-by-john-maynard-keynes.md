  The Economic Consequences of the Peace;
  , by John Maynard Keynes
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Personally, I am a follower of Austrian School of economics, Ron Paul, and libertarian approach but since, as well said in the Art of War, "to know your enemy is to win the battle," I am uploading this famous/infamous book of John Maynard Keynes.
  Of course I don't endorse the view of Keynes but the book is still useful to win the battle against Keynesian ideas.
  Thank you.
  Following is the summary from Graham McMillan.
  The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) was a best seller throughout the world, published by John Maynard Keynes. Keynes attended the Versailles Conference as a delegate of the British Treasury and argued for a much more generous peace with Germany. The book was critical in establishing a general worldwide opinion that the Versailles Treaty was a brutal and unfair peace towards Germany. It helped to consolidate American public opinion against the treaty and involvement in the League of Nations. The perception by much of the British public that Germany had been treated unfairly in turn was a crucial factor in public support for appeasement. The success of the book established Keynes' reputation as a leading economist especially on the left. (Summary by Graham McMillan)
