[Music]<br>these people always limp seem to live<br>long lives don&#39;t they<br>the Kissinger&#39;s and the father bushes<br>and the David Rockefellers and the Queen<br>Mother in in England live to a hundred<br>and two and the Queen in England now is<br>well of age because they&#39;re not given<br>the same treatment health treatment the<br>rest of us get there&#39;s one of the bloody<br>reasons and also other things that they<br>do which are very dark satanic and to do<br>with the the energy and children but<br>father George Bush as cut he&#39;s such a<br>classic purveyor of this madness this<br>insanity that they want to impose upon<br>the world and as presidents go he&#39;s a<br>bit higher up the ladder than say his<br>son or some of some of the others and I<br>would want to confront him with not just<br>questions about his role through the<br>years in so many things because coming<br>from a a bloodline family he would have<br>been brought from birth you would be<br>developed to be in the positions that he<br>was in head of the CIA and the Vice<br>President President and all these other<br>things that he was involved in but<br>there&#39;s another area of father George<br>Bush which is is something that a lot of<br>conspiracy research doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t<br>cover but but really needs to and that<br>is pedophilia it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a deep<br>rabbit hole but when you connect the<br>dots you can explain why the ratio of<br>pedophiles to positions of power<br>especially in the higher levels is<br>fantastic compared with the ratio of<br>pedophiles in the general population but<br>this man father George Bush has not just<br>been responsible for the most<br>unspeakable grotesque unimaginable<br>sexual abuse and torture of children<br>using various electromagnetic<br>technologies and such that caused<br>enormous pain for the kids who were<br>tortured this this this guy&#39;s been<br>responsible for the deaths of goodness<br>knows how many children and I&#39;d met some<br>of the adults that he abused his<br>children and survived and they are<br>absolutely scrambled mentally<br>emotionally and physically because of<br>the horrors that this man put them<br>through now there&#39;s a number of reasons<br>Luke why we need to look at this and<br>expose this first of all to stop the<br>kids having that done to them but also<br>to let people see into the minds and the<br>mentality of those that are behind this<br>global conspiracy because it became<br>clear to me I talked at length about<br>this and go deeply into the it when I<br>speak and in my books but just keep it<br>on on the level of outcome rather than<br>all the dots that show white weights<br>like this but there is something about<br>their genetics which has deleted empathy<br>it&#39;s deleted the ability to feel the<br>consequences for others of your actions<br>and if you think about it empathy is the<br>failsafe mechanism of human behavior<br>because if I have empathy feelings for<br>how you will feel from my actions then<br>there is an immediate limit on my<br>actions I&#39;m not going to do something to<br>you because I I have empathy with how it<br>will make you feel delete that they&#39;re<br>in there are no limits so I&#39;ve said to<br>people for<br>nearly 20 years don&#39;t look at these<br>people and judge what they would do on<br>the basis of what you would do because<br>it&#39;s not the same thing you know<br>orchestrating attacks on 9/11 which<br>killed 3,000 people around 3,000 people<br>so was what we wouldn&#39;t think about it<br>but even if we did think about it the<br>empathy with not only that those those<br>that died and those suffered Horrors in<br>the horrors in those buildings as they<br>collapsed but all the families we could<br>never do that<br>delete empathy and 3,000 people get on<br>9/11 and you know so what that&#39;s the<br>attitude that they have and people can&#39;t<br>kind of understand that they think no no<br>no they would never do that well hold on<br>a second if you will take a little a<br>little child before the age of six five<br>or six is when they want them you will<br>put them into mind control projects that<br>involve grotesque trauma emotionally<br>mental and physically trauma and you<br>will sexually abuse them you will use<br>cattle prongs too as a punishment and as<br>a way of getting them into a state of<br>total submission to your will you will<br>torture them you will make them watch<br>animals and children being sacrificed as<br>a form of incredible trauma you&#39;ll find<br>out their greatest fear and you&#39;ll make<br>them experience it over and over again<br>to break them mentally and emotionally<br>and you will do that over and over and<br>over again that&#39;s father George Bush and<br>he&#39;s just one of them<br>you would pepper bomb Baghdad and have<br>no emotional consequences you would do<br>9/11 have no emotional consequences you<br>would put a virus out there to kill<br>large numbers of people no emotional<br>consequences you would put stuff in<br>vaccines designed to affect people<br>mentally emotionally and physically<br>you would have a eugenics operation you<br>would plan and scheme to dramatically<br>reduce the population and you would have<br>no empathy with the consequences of your<br>actions that others would feel that&#39;s<br>the mentality loop that we&#39;re dealing<br>with and and because they&#39;re not like<br>the general human population they don&#39;t<br>see the world and they don&#39;t see life in<br>the same way and that&#39;s the force we&#39;re<br>dealing with and we need to get<br>streetwise to that and then we&#39;ll have a<br>chance of dealing with it because why we<br>say they&#39;d never do that no you&#39;d never<br>do that they do it every day<br>[Music]<br>
