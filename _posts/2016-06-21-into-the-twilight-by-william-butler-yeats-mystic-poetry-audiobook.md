post_excerpt: |
  OUT-WORN heart, in a time out-worn,
  Come clear of the nets of wrong and right;
  Laugh heart again in the gray twilight,
  Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.
  Your mother Eire is always young,
  Dew ever shining and twilight gray;
  Though hope fall from you and love decay,
  Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.
  Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:
  For there the mystical brotherhood
  Of sun and moon and hollow and wood
  And river and stream work out their will;
  And God stands winding His lonely horn,
  And time and the world are ever in flight;
  And love is less kind than the gray twilight,
  And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.

<p>OUT-WORN heart, in a time out-worn,  
Come clear of the nets of wrong and right;  
Laugh heart again in the gray twilight,  
Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.  
Your mother Eire is always young,          
Dew ever shining and twilight gray;  
Though hope fall from you and love decay,  
Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.    
Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:  
For there the mystical brotherhood   
Of sun and moon and hollow and wood  
And river and stream work out their will;    
And God stands winding His lonely horn,  
And time and the world are ever in flight;  
And love is less kind than the gray twilight,   
And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.
