  Warning! Although this is a great supernatural thriller with intertwined curse and secrets, it has several offensive remarks regarding various ethnic groups. This was the cultural reflection of his era in British history. But the book itself is very interesting and well written so I decided to post it. Also, the thumbnail image is the creation of over_clox.
