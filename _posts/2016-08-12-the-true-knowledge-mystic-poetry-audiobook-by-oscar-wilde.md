post_excerpt: |
  Thou knowest all; I seek in vain
  What lands to till or sow with seed -
  The land is black with briar and weed,
  Nor cares for falling tears or rain.
  Thou knowest all; I sit and wait
  With blinded eyes and hands that fail,
  Till the last lifting of the veil
  And the first opening of the gate.
  Thou knowest all; I cannot see.
  I trust I shall not live in vain,
  I know that we shall meet again
  In some divine eternity.

And the first opening of the gate.
