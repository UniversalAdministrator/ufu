post_title: '[Occult Lecture on Mysticism &#038; Its Practical Approach] The Life of the Spirit;  #UfU'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  This book was originally a lecture given by the author of my recent upload "Mysticism",  Evelyn Underhill.
  It dealt with applying practical approaches of mysticism while living our modern life.
  Later it was edited and published into a book format.
  Occult and Mysticism writers came from diverse backgrounds and Underhill was a prominent one from esoteric Christianity/ Christian mysticism spectrum.
  So her approach to the subject would differ significantly with other well known occult/mysticism thinkers and writers.
