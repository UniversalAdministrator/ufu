  This is a very profound occult-paranormal fiction and the only occult fiction written by Jack London but it turned out to be a brilliant one. Focusing on astral projection and past life-regression, this is a very inspiring and thought-provoking book that can satisfy the both of seasoned readers of occult books and newbies who just started looking into this genre of writings. Either way, you will be pleasantly surprised.
