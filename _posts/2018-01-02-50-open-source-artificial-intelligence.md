<div class="litcontent">

Since the earliest days of computers, creating machines that could "think" like humans has been a key goal for researchers. In the past few years, computer scientists have made huge leaps forward in artificial intelligence (AI), to the point where the technology is becoming commonplace.

In fact, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3763265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner predicts</a>, "By 2020, AI technologies will be virtually pervasive in almost every new software product and service." And <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42439617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDC forecasts</a> that companies will spend $12.5 billion on AI technology in 2017, 59.3 percent more than in 2016. That tremendous growth is likely to continue through 2020, when revenues could top $46 billion.

Open source software development has played a huge role in the rise of artificial intelligence, and many of the top machine learning, deep learning, neural network and other AI software is available under open source licenses.

For this list, we selected 50 of the most well-known of these open source artificial intelligence projects. They are organized into categories and then alphabetized within those categories. The lines between some of the categories can be fuzzy, so we used the project owners' descriptions of their applications to determine where to place the various tools.
