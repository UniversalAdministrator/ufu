  The Eldritch Dark (For H. P. Lovecraft
  Fans) by Clark Ashton Smith, , Poetry
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Now as the twilight's doubtful interval
  Closes with night's accomplished certainty,
  A wizard wind goes crying eerily,
  And on the wold misshapen shadows crawl,
  Miming the trees, whose voices climb and fall,
  Imploring, in Sabbatic ecstacy,
  The sky where vapor-mounted phantoms flee
  From the scythed moon impendent over all.
  Twin veils of covering cloud and silence, thrown
  Across the movement and the sound of things,
  Make blank the night, till in the broken west
  The moon's ensanguined blade awhile is shown....
  The night grows whole again....The shadows rest,
  Gathered beneath a greater shadow's wings.
  ----End---

<p>Now as the twilight's doubtful interval
Closes with night's accomplished certainty,
A wizard wind goes crying eerily,
And on the wold misshapen shadows crawl,
Miming the trees, whose voices climb and fall,
Imploring, in Sabbatic ecstacy,
The sky where vapor-mounted phantoms flee
From the scythed moon impendent over all.
Twin veils of covering cloud and silence, thrown
Across the movement and the sound of things,
Make blank the night, till in the broken west
The moon's ensanguined blade awhile is shown....
The night grows whole again....The shadows rest,
Gathered beneath a greater shadow's wings.
