  The Valley of Unrest, a Poem by Edgar
  Allan Poe,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  Once it smiled a silent dell
  Where the people did not dwell;
  They had gone unto the wars,
  Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
  Nightly, from their azure towers,
  To keep watch above the flowers,
  In the midst of which all day
  The red sun-light lazily lay.
  Now each visitor shall confess
  The sad valley's restlessness.
  Nothing there is motionless—
  Nothing save the airs that brood
  Over the magic solitude.
  Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
  That palpitate like the chill seas
  Around the misty Hebrides!
  Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
  That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
  Uneasily, from morn till even,
  Over the violets there that lie
  In myriad types of the human eye—
  Over the lilies there that wave
  And weep above a nameless grave!
  They wave:—from out their fragrant tops
  External dews come down in drops.
  They weep:—from off their delicate stems
  Perennial tears descend in gems.
  -End-
