<h1><strong>THE MANY WAYS OF FUNGI:</strong>
BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, CULTIVATION, AND APPLICATIONS 101</h1>
<h4><strong>THIS COURSE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN RUNNING SPRING OF 2019.

&nbsp;

Discovering mycology is a life-changing experience. As you learn about all that fungi do in the environment and their seemingly endless answers to some of the world’s biggest challenges, you begin to view the world through new eyes. Fungi not only offer vital insights into the ways of the natural world, but also tangible means for envisioning and building a more resilient means for living on Earth.

The only problem with such a big topic as mycology is knowing where to start. With few places to study the topic, finding a clear map of this vast science is often the biggest hurdle for people wanting to begin their life journey of working with fungi.

In this course, you will be guided through all that mycology offers – from its history and modern practical applications, to the unique biology and ecological roles of fungi.
