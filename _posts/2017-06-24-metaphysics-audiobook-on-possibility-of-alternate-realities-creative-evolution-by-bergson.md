post_title: '[Metaphysics Audiobook] (On Possibility of Alternate Realities) &#8220;Creative Evolution&#8221; (by Bergson)'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  The author Bergson went against Darwin's evolution theory and came up with a theory which emphasizes creative/metaphysical forces in man which cannot be explained with Darwin's theory. This book starts off rather gently and gets deeper and heavier as pages turned. If you want to understand metaphysics, mind-expansion and the possibility of alternate realities, try this book. Enjoy!
