<p>Although the background setting of this book is Chinese, it is similar to "the Arabian Nights." Both are a collection of curious tales narrated by a person who are facing a grave punishment and trying to delay and avoid the punishment by keep telling interesting and fantastic stories. If you enjoy those curious tales from the ancient time, this book might be a great listen.
