<p>This is a very thorough book offering an in-depth analysis of Japanese spirituality, written by Lafcadio Hearn, who married Japanese woman and lived there for decades.
The first half of this book deals with spirituality of Japan and its history. The latter half deals with the comprehensive effects of Japanese spirituality combined with social and political context.
