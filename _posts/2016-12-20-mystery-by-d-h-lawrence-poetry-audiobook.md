post_excerpt: |
  Now I am all
  One bowl of kisses,
  Such as the tall
  Slim votaresses
  Of Egypt filled
  For a God's excesses.
  I lift to you
  My bowl of kisses,
  And through the temple's
  Blue recesses
  Cry out to you
  In wild caresses.
  And to my lips'
  Bright crimson rim
  The passion slips,
  And down my slim
  White body drips
  The shining hymn.
  And still before
  The altar I
  Exult the bowl
  Brimful, and cry
  To you to stoop
  And drink, Most High.
  Oh drink me up
  That I may be
  Within your cup
  Like a mystery,
  Like wine that is still
  In ecstasy.
  Glimmering still
  In ecstasy,
  Commingled wines
  Of you and me
  In one fulfil
  The mystery.

<p>Now I am all
One bowl of kisses,
Such as the tall
Slim votaresses
Of Egypt filled
For a God's excesses.
I lift to you
My bowl of kisses,
And through the temple's
Blue recesses
Cry out to you
In wild caresses.
And to my lips'
Bright crimson rim
The passion slips,
And down my slim
White body drips
The shining hymn.
And still before

Exult the bowl
Brimful, and cry
To you to stoop
And drink, Most High.
Oh drink me up
That I may be
Within your cup
Like a mystery,
Like wine that is still
In ecstasy.
Glimmering still
In ecstasy,
Commingled wines
Of you and me
In one fulfil
The mystery.
