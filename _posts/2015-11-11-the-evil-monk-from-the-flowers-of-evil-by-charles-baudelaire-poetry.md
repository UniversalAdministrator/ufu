post_excerpt: |
  The cloisters old, expounded on their walls
  With paintings, the Beatic Verity,
  The which—adorning their religious halls,
  Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.
  In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land,
  Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,
  Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,
  Exalting Death in rude and simple way.
  My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be—
  I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,
  And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.
  Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright
  From the living spectacle of my bitter lot,
  To mold my handywork and mine eyes' Delight?
  ---- End ----
