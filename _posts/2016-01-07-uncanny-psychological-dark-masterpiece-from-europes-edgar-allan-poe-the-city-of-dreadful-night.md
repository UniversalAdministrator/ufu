  If you love Edgar Allan Poe, you don't want to miss this one! To give you some ideas regarding this very long poem, here is the brief quote from the poem. "O melancholy Brothers, dark, dark, dark!
  O battling in black floods without an ark!
  O spectral wanderers of unholy Night!
  My soul hath bled for you these sunless years,
  With bitter blood-drops running down like tears:
  Oh dark, dark, dark, withdrawn from joy and light!
  My heart is sick with anguish for your bale;
  Your woe hath been my anguish; yea, I quail
  And perish in your perishing unblest.
  And I have searched the highths and depths, the scope
  Of all our universe, with desperate hope
  To find some solace for your wild unrest.
  And now at last authentic word I bring,
  Witnessed by every dead and living thing;
  Good tidings of great joy for you, for all:
  There is no God; no Fiend with names divine
  Made us and tortures us; if we must pine,
  It is to satiate no Being's gall.
  It was the dark delusion of a dream,
  That living Person conscious and supreme,
  Whom we must curse for cursing us with life;
  Whom we must curse because the life he gave
  Could not be buried in the quiet grave,
  Could not be killed by poison or the knife.
  This little life is all we must endure,
  The grave's most holy peace is ever sure,
  We fall asleep and never wake again;
  Nothing is of us but the mouldering flesh,
  Whose elements dissolve and merge afresh
  In earth, air, water, plants, and other men."
