author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  This is a fascinating book dealing with the unethical tactics used by various rulers to extort money from the citizen (the second part of the book dealing with this fascinating subject and the second part starts at 15:09 mark. The first part is basic theories but still  enjoyable listen.) And it seems history repeats itself over and over again!
