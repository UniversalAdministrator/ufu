<p>First produced between 1684-1688, this is Faust played as a comedy. Angels to go along with Mephistopholis and Lucifer and Beelzebub, sure, but also the Seven Deadly Sins and wait a minute - Scaramouche and Harlequin?? (The author Mountfort was also an actor and was killed trying to prevent an attempt to kidnap an actress in a case that ended up in the House of Lords.) - Summary by ToddHW
