post_excerpt: |
  Where a faint light shines alone,
  Dwells a Demon I have known.
  Most of you had better say
  "The Dark House", and go your way.
  Do not wonder if I stay.
  For I know the Demon's eyes,
  And their lure that never dies.
  Banish all your fond alarms,
  For I know the foiling charms
  Of her eyes and of her arms,
  And I know that in one room
  Burns a lamp as in a tomb;
  And I see the shadow glide,
  Back and forth, of one denied
  Power to find himself outside.
  There he is who is my friend,
  Damned, he fancies, to the end—
  Vanquished, ever since a door
  Closed, he thought, for evermore
  On the life that was before.
  And the friend who knows him best
  Sees him as he sees the rest
  Who are striving to be wise
  While a Demon's arms and eyes
  Hold them as a web would flies.
  All the words of all the world,
  Aimed together and then hurled,
  Would be stiller in his ears
  Than a closing of still shears
  On a thread made out of years.
  But there lives another sound,
  More compelling, more profound;
  There's a music, so it seems,
  That assuages and redeems,
  More than reason, more than dreams.
  There's a music yet unheard
  By the creature of the word,
  Though it matters little more
  Than a wave-wash on a shore—
  Till a Demon shuts a door.
  So, if he be very still
  With his Demon, and one will,
  Murmurs of it may be blown
  To my friend who is alone
  In a room that I have known.
  After that from everywhere
  Singing life will find him there;
  Then the door will open wide,
  And my friend, again outside,
  Will be living, having died
  ---- End ----
