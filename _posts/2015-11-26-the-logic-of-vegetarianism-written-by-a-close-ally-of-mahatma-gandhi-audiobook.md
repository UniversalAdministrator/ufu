<p>It was the author Henry Salt who first introduced Mahatma Gandhi  to the influential works of Henry David Thoreau, and influenced Gandhi's study of vegetarianism. And with clear logic and entertaining dialogues, the author presents many reasons for a vegetarian rather than a “flesh-eating” diet, and his arguments for not eating meat are as compelling today as when they were written.
