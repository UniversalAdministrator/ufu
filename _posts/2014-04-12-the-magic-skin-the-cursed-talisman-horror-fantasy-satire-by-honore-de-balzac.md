  The Magic Skin (The Cursed Talisman)
  (Horror + Fantasy + Satire) by Honoré
  de Balzac,
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  This is a very unique book that defies any limiting genre.
  It's a mixture of horror, fantasy and  satire with a strong undertone of social commentary as well.
  This book is relatively long and takes time to take off. But once it gets rolling, it becomes very interesting.
