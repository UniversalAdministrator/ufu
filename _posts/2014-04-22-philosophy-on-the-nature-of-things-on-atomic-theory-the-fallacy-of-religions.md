post_title: '[Philosophy] On the Nature of Things (on Atomic Theory &#038; the Fallacy of Religions),'
author: UfU
post_excerpt: |
  This book is, in a way, like 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' that it explains philosophy with poetry. Also, the preface is very long (48 minutes) and if you want to jump into the main part, then go to 48:13 mark.
  Written in the first century b.C., On the Nature of Things (in Latin, De Rerum Natura) is a poem in six books that aims at explaining the Epicurean philosophy to the Roman audience. Among digressions about the importance of philosophy in men's life and praises of Epicurus, Lucretius created a solid treatise on the atomic theory, the falseness of religion and many kinds of natural phenomena. With no harm to his philosophical scope, the author composed a didactic poem of epic flavor, of which the imagery and style are highly praised. (Summary by Leni)
  [Philosophy] On the Nature of Things (on the Fallacy of Religions), by Titus Lucretius Carus, Audiobook
