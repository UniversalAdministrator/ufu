<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to observe its wonder, be constantly void. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means guarding the void. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sage therefore manages all affairs through non-action. <br>
This means being natural. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep the people from becoming robbers. <br>
This means that when there is no evil breath, robbers cannot <br>
enter. If one practices the One, then evil breath leaves. <br>
Not seeing what may excite desires <br>
This means non-action. <br>
Keeps the mind a way from disorder. <br>
This means the constant guarding of the One. <br>
Therefore, in a sage's government, <br>
This means the mastering of the body. <br>
He empties the mind and fills the abdomen. <br>
"He empties the mind" is having no evil thoughts. "Fills the <br>
abdomen" is blocking breath and cultivating tranquillity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TAO is void, yet it is used. <br>
"Void" means the One. It is the One which is in the body. A person should often practice it. <br>
It will never overflow. <br>
This means guarding nature. <br>
It resolves tangles. <br>
This means that there is no anger. <br>
It is in harmony with the light. <br>
The way (TAO) of the wise man is constantly in harmony with the spiritual light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heaven is everlasting and earth is long enduring. The reason why heaven and earth are able to last and endure is because they do not live for themselves. They can <br>
therefore live long. <br>
"Heaven is everlasting" rneans the mudball (NI WAN.) "Earth is long enduring" means (the lower) elixir field (TAN T'IEN.) <br>
The mudball goes down to the scarlet palace (CHIANG­ KUNG) and the elixir field ascends to practice the One (HSING Yl.) The upper and lower primordial breaths flow and meet. Hundreds of joints are immersed and moistened. <br>
The harmonious breath will be produced naturally. So is the great way (TAO) completed. It therefore says, "Live long." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The attributes of the superior instinct resemble those of water. <br>
"Instinct" indicates the saliva in the mouth. Rinse with it, <br>
then the sweet spring appears. Hold it and swallow it. It will go down to benefit thousands of spirits. If you want to practice this, you should often rinse the flowery pond (HUA­<br>
CH' IH) in the morning. When your mouth is full of saliva, lift up your head and swallow the saliva so as to benefit thousands of spirits and increase your vitality. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(During) speech , (this) instinct is trustworthy. This means that when vitality flows throughout the body, thousands of spirits assemble. The sweet spring in your mouth will <br>
therefore gush naturally. You can rinse with it and swallow it endlessly. If people do not know this, how could they practice this? Therefore, when the sage practices the One, how could there be no early splendor? <br>
When in action, this instinct is timely. <br>
This means that when a sage serves the way (TAO), he heals his body by removing evil and guile. This is to be taken later as a model by the wise. The seven (attributes of) the instinct come about because the One is circulating throughout the body benefiting thousands of spirits (the word SHAN, perfection, virtue, instinct appears seven times in this version of the eighth chapter of the TAO TE CHING) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should you try to strike and sharpen an edge, the edge will not last long. <br>
To strike in the upper part means to let out words. To strike in the lower part means to lose control over the vitality (the semen) Letting out words causes discord. Losing control over vitality causes your hair to turn gray and your teeth to fall out. <br>
When gold and jade fill your hall, you will not be able to keep them safe. <br>
This means that breath and blood are the gold, the semen is <br>
the jade. If you practice the One, the upper and lower parts <br>
will open up to each other. There will be loud noises. Your <br>
limbs and joints will help each other. Your eyes will be bright <br>
and sparkling. These are the effects of fulfilling the One. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arrogance with wealth and honor will bring about your downfall. <br>
This means that those who enjoy riches and honor are mostly <br>
greedy for power and wealth. They are not willing to study <br>
the way (TAO.) They will die. When they die, they cannot <br>
retain their power and wealth. Even if they have accumulated <br>
an enormous arnount of money, of what use will it be to them <br>
when they are already dead? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can you become baby-like? <br>
This means enmbracing and practicing the primordial breath <br>
without toiling. The great way (TAO) flows and spreads out <br>
(with the natural grace of) a baby. <br>
Can you be without knowledge while your intelligence <br>
reaches the four quarters? <br>
"Reaches the four quarters " is to know the eight directions. <br>
To close your mind and block your thoughts will enable you to <br>
exist for thousands of generations . If you can practice this, <br>
you will be known to the Supreme August. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The function of a vessel arises from non-being. <br>
This means that when the ancients molded clay into a vessel, <br>
the vessel had to be fired to get rid of the water since <br>
otherwise the vessel would fail and would not become a <br>
vessel. If you want to practice the way (TAO) and (yet) do <br>
not enter a room to refine your body regularly, then you will <br>
only be an ordinary person certain to die. <br>
Thus, practical results arise from its being. <br>
This states the existence of the way (TAO.) <br>
The function arises from its non-being. <br>
This states that a sage holds the One and practices naturalness. <br>
He does not need anything else. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The five colors blind men's eyes. <br>
This does not mean that human beings are blind. You would <br>
like to see, but all you see are the black and yellow colors (of <br>
heaven and earth, ) You do not see the coming and going <br>
of the divinities, their jeweled carriage and their brilliant five­<br>
colored light. This is why it says, "blind men's eyes." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The five musical sounds deafen men's ears. <br>
This does not mean that human beings are deaf. You would <br>
like to hear, but all you can hear is the sounds of chimes and <br>
drums. You do not hear the sound of the divinities. This is <br>
why it says, "deafen men's ears." <br>
Galloping, chasing, and hunting maddens the human <br>
mind. <br>
This means that when a man dies, he returns to dust. His <br>
family attending the funeral, his relatives running around for <br>
the funeral, the confusion, the crying, the weeping, the burial <br>
into the grave, and the funeral procession through the fields, <br>
all of this makes the close relatives frantic and the distant ones <br>
sad. This is why it says, "maddens." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achieving it is a surprise. <br>
This means that when the way (TAO) is achieved, thousands <br>
of spirits come along and sing in your abdomen. They meet <br>
and talk to you. When the five spirits are known, the <br>
primordial breath flows freely. This is why it says, <br>
"Achieving it is a surprise". <br>
Losing it, is a surprise. <br>
This means that once the breath is lost and the sperm is spent, <br>
the vitality is depleted and as a consequence, the One is lost. <br>
Your hair will turn gray, your teeth will fall out and you will <br>
die. The cries frorn people's grief rise to the sky and the <br>
lamentations of the souls startle the divinities in heaven. This <br>
is why it says, "Losing it, is a surprise." <br>
If I had no body, what calamity could come to me? <br>
To be oblivious of the body and to nourish the vitality is called <br>
"had no body".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being unceasing and continuous, it cannot be defined. <br>
This means the way (TAO) enters your skin, bones, and <br>
joints. It says, therefore, that "being unceasing and <br>
continuous, it cannot be defined". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the highest supreme exists, those who are lower <br>
know its existence. <br>
This means that it is known that the mudball (NI-WAN) is in <br>
the upper part and the elixir field (TAN T' lEN) in the lower <br>
part. The male and the female meet in the scarlet palace <br>
(CHIANG-KUNG.) Closing the mind and holding your fists <br>
tight will make the primordial breath flow and circulate. Your <br>
ears will hear divine sounds. You know that in the lower part <br>
there is the noise in the abdomen. When you practice the <br>
One, there will be the music of the chimes and the drums. <br>
Next, they would get close and praise. <br>
"Getting close" refers to the superior souls, "praising" to the <br>
inferior souls. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Renounce learning and anxiety will end. <br>
This means that you should do away with canons and books <br>
and practice the One. <br>
The life force is latent in darkness and unfathomable. <br>
This means that the Primordial Breath is transformed into life <br>
force. <br>
Life force is of the essence. In it is the evidence. <br>
This refers to the semen. The perfect man is the one whose <br>
semen does not transform and blood does not hide. He practices the One in his body which therefore (appears or) is <br>
the evidence. <br>
Its name has never vanished from ancient times up to now. <br>
"Name" refers to the way (TAO.) The sage never dies. His <br>
name lives forever. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abundance causes perplexity. <br>
This means that ordinary people have many thoughts and <br>
desires. They have no confidence in themselves. Therefore, <br>
they are perplexed. <br>
The sage therefore embraces the One and becomes a model <br>
to the world . <br>
This means it is good to remember the One and practice the <br>
way (TAO) and hold it in the body. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Revolving (it) without being weary <br>
This means that the sage practices the One in his body. It <br>
flows and circulates through his four limbs, hundreds of <br>
joints, nine orifices and hundreds of channels. This is why it <br>
says, "revolving (it) without being weary". <br>
May be regarded as the mother of the world. <br>
This means that guarding the way (TAO) so as to hold on to <br>
the One is the mother of the world. <br>
Within the realm, there are four that are great. <br>
The king is one of them. <br>
This means that the lungs are great, the heart is great, the liver <br>
is great, and the spleen is great. The water of the kidneys produces the One and the king dwells in the One. This means <br>
that the breath of the spleen rules over the four directions. <br>
That is the practice of the One. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(How can a ruler) regard the body lightly in the world? <br>
This means treating death lightly. Even a man as noble as a <br>
king should hold the One to prolong life. <br>
To see this but not to learn from it is taking the body lightly. <br>
When he dies, even though he may have jade and gold <br>
engravings, how could they benefit his body? <br>
Hastiness destroys self-mastery. <br>
This means that he who is hasty cannot live long. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He who closes well needs no bolts, yet it (the door) <br>
cannot be opened. <br>
This refers to the blocking of the breath and holding the fists <br>
tight. The heavenly female is being locked in the upper part, <br>
the earthly male is being locked in the lower part. This is why <br>
it says, "needs no bolts". <br>
An able binder needs no rope, yet his knot cannot be <br>
untied. <br>
This indicates binding and holding the souls. The sage <br>
embraces the superior souls and holds the inferior souls. This <br>
is why it says, "cannot be untied". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being aware of maleness, yet keeping to femaleness is being <br>
the gorge (repository) of the world. <br>
"Maleness" refers to the superior souls, "femaleness" refers to <br>
the inferior souls. This means that the spirits come and go <br>
inside the body. He who practices the One therefore imitates <br>
and guards the nature, holds the fists tight, and blocks off the <br>
breath to embrace and hold the souls. <br>
Being the gorge of the world, you are able to retain the <br>
constant virtue and return to infancy. <br>
"The gorge" is the mouth. This means to practice the One and <br>
block the breath. Following profoundly non-action will <br>
prevent you from aging. You will return to infancy. <br>
Being a model to the world is having constant unerring <br>
virtue, <br>
This means that the way (TAO) is for the immortal to practice <br>
the One so as to be a model to the world. <br>
Returning to infinity, <br>
"Infinity" means constantly sustaining life and practicing the <br>
One. <br>
(And) returning to the natural uncarved block. <br>
This means retaining naturalness. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To assist a ruler by upholding the way (TAO) is not to <br>
make use of arms to conquer the world. <br>
This refers to the mouth as the use of the force of arms. A <br>
slip of the tongue causes the use of the force of arms. Vitality <br>
(the sperrn) will leap and bound and the upper and <br>
lower souls will infringe upon each other. Then the spirits <br>
will be disturbed and leave the body. <br>
These matters will certainly earn their due back. <br>
This means that if, when you practice the One, your mind is <br>
peaceful and your will calm, the spirits will return to your <br>
body. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sharp weapons are instruments of bad omen. <br>
The expression "instruments of bad omen" refers to those <br>
who, because they talk heedlessly, will lose their live body. <br>
When the body is endangered, the instruments are destroyed as <br>
well. <br>
They are not the instruments of a superior man. <br>
This means that the mouth brings about discussions and thus <br>
causes use of the force of arms. When the Yin (ejaculation) is strong, its ax will kill the body, thus being "the instruments of bad omen."" </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He who behaves strongly, has a firm will. <br>
This means that the way (TAO) is to be practiced day and <br>
night without any break. <br>
He who does not lose his place, endures. <br>
This means that the One is not lost. <br>
He who dies yet does not perish has longevity. <br>
This means that to experience "deliverance from the corpse" <br>
(SHIH CHIEH), is to be reborn after death. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having attained the One, the heavens are purified. <br>
This means that the mud ball (NI WAN) is in a person's head, <br>
wherefrom the fresh and pure breath descends. This is why it <br>
is said, "are purified".<br>
Having attained the One, the earth is peaceful. <br>
This means that when there is no licentiousness in the elixir <br>
field (TAN T'IEN), the vitality will reside in the body. It is <br>
said, therefore, "peaceful". <br>
Having attained the One, the spirit is magically responsive. <br>
"The spirit" is the mind. The mind is divinely magical, it is <br>
the lord of the five viscera. This is why it says "magically <br>
responsive. " <br>
Having attained the One, the valley is full. <br>
"The valley" is the mouth which is the palace of the flowery <br>
pond that can bring about the sweet spring. Therefore, it is <br>
said, "full". <br>
Having attained the One, thousands of entities are alive. <br>
This means that thousands of entities are different in form, yet <br>
they all share in the possession of the One in order to live. <br>
This is why it is said, "alive". <br>
Having attained the One, the nobles and the king are <br>
rectified. <br>
This indicates the spleen which is in the middle, in order to <br>
control the four directions. It is said, therefore, "are <br>
rectified". <br>
The One brings about all of these. <br>
This means that heaven and earth, man, spirit, water, spring, <br>
and thousands of entities all share in the One in order to live. <br>
This is why it is said, "The One brings about all of these <br>
things". <br>
Without clarity, heaven might disintegrate. <br>
This says that if the mudball (Nl WAN) does not attain the <br>
One, the brain will wither, the hair will gray, and the teeth <br>
will fall out. It says, therefore, "disintegrate". <br>
Without tranquillity, the earth might be agitated. <br>
This means that if the elixir field (TAN T'IEN) does not attain the One, then vitality will dissipate. It says, therefore, "might be agitated". <br>
Without magical responsiveness, the spirit might end. <br>
This means that if the mind is disorderly, the body is empty <br>
and ages fast. It says, therefore, "might end". <br>
Without being filled, the valley might be parched. <br>
This means that when the mouth loses the One, the flowery <br>
pond does not produce saliva. It says, therefore, "parched". <br>
Nobility must, therefore, have its origin in humbleness. <br>
This means that if a man seeks longevity, he should regard the <br>
Primordial Breath as (his) mother. This is why it says, <br>
"origin" . <br>
The high must have the low as its foundation. <br>
This means that a person practicing the way (TAO) should <br>
regard the elixir field of primordial importance for nurturing <br>
his vitality and strengthening his brain. Therefore , it says, "as <br>
its foundation". <br>
Therefore, the highest renown is without renown. <br>
This means that the way (TAO) is the original truth. <br>
It is nameless. Embrace the One and hold (it) inside. <br>
Do not seek it from outside. This is why it says, "without <br>
renown". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making a big vessel takes long. <br>
This means that holding the One without weariness helps to <br>
attain the way (TAO) in old age. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping still, overcomes heat.<br>
"Keeping still, overcomes heat" means that non-action insures <br>
the spirit to hold the One. <br>
Being pure and calm is the right model to the world. <br>
This means that going into a remote mountain to practice <br>
keeping pure in order to guard nature will make you become a <br>
perfect man . </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regard the mind of hundreds of surnames (the people) as <br>
your own mind. <br>
This means that when you know the way (TAO) and practice <br>
breathing , by holding the spirit as the mind, your breath will <br>
flow and spread to hundreds of joints which have hundreds of <br>
spirits with hundreds of different names sharing a dwelling in <br>
your body. It says, therefore, "regard other people's mind as <br>
your own mind" . <br>
Then goodness is attained. <br>
This means that when you practice the One to nurture the <br>
spirit, the spirit will be harmonious and the form pliant. Evil <br>
will vanish and only what is right and good will be left. Your <br>
bones will be strong and your marrow genuine. This is why it <br>
says, "goodness is attained". <br>
Faith is attained. <br>
This means that if man has faith in the One, then the One also <br>
has faith in man. If man has no faith in the One, then the One <br>
is produced according to man. Therefore, the way (TAO) <br>
constantly cornprises faith. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In him (a sage), there is no place for death. This means that a sage embraces the spirit, holds the One, <br>
practices breathing and holds his fists tight to do the <br>
Embryonic Breathing. The principle (TAO) that nothing can <br>
hurt is in his mind and the Genuine Breath is present. There <br>
is, therefore, no place for destruction. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I had great knowledge, I would walk on the great way <br>
(TAO.) <br>
Day and night, I would be most anxious to think of and hold <br>
the One in my body . <br>
Yet people like the small by-paths. <br>
This means that people like what is evil and false. They walk <br>
on the wrong byways. <br>
The field is filled with weeds. <br>
This means that man does not cultivate the One. Day and <br>
night he improves his (exterior) appearance (by eating grains) so he fails and becomes ill. His mind is, therefore, ill­<br>
cultivated. <br>
The granaries are quite empty. <br>
This means that if man does not hold and strengthen the One, <br>
his five viscera will be empty. It says, therefore, "empty". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrying sharp swords, <br>
This means that if a man likes to dress up in beautiful clothes, <br>
the One will leave and evil will come in. Carrying sharp <br>
swords and relying on weapons is what devils cause harm <br>
with. <br>
And having a superabundance of wealth is called <br>
brigandage and boastfulness. <br>
This means that if a man likes good food to improve his <br>
appearance, the One will leave him. Hundreds of diseases will then appear. His wealth will be used towards (his) death <br>
and funeral. <br>
This is not the way (TAO.) <br>
This means that such a man does not practice the One. If a <br>
man thinks only of fine clothes and delicacies, he may become <br>
a robber. He cannot prevent the illness nor remove death. <br>
Therefore, that is not the way (TAO.) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is firmly planted cannot be pulled out. <br>
This means that an expert or a superior man, who is skillful in <br>
building up his body and (his) mind through the virtues of the <br>
way (TAO), has neither virtues to show off nor feats for <br>
which to be glorified. Then his building is deeply rooted and <br>
firmly established. It cannot be uprooted by any whim of <br>
right and wrong and likes or dislikes. If the building (the <br>
body) is made only so that he may boast with virtues, <br>
seek fame, show off merits or expect rewards, then after its <br>
beauty and virtue are displayed, its hidden merit is still not <br>
accomplished. <br>
Eventually, it will be uprooted by the impermanence and <br>
hindrance of its past destiny. Therefore, Huai Nan Tzu said, <br>
"Though the appearance of a building is splendid and strong, <br>
it can still be destroyed by a fire. Though fire is hot, it may <br>
be extinguished by water. Though water flows, it may be <br>
stopped by earth . Though wood is strong, it may be cut by an <br>
ax. Therefore, only he who can build what is not a (physical) <br>
building, will not be uprooted." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who know do not speak, <br>
This means the One is indescribable. <br>
(And) those who speak do not know. <br>
This means that those who talk do not know the One. <br>
Block the aperture, close the doors. <br>
This means one is to close off the nine orifices , protect the life <br>
force and hold the breath. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule a nation through proper and correct measure. When <br>
using arms, practice surprise. <br>
This means that those who nourish the body should be right in <br>
their mind. They should not hurt themselves by the arms of <br>
the mouth. "A nation" refers to the body. <br>
The more prohibitions there are in the world, the poorer <br>
the people become. <br>
This means having action. <br>
Therefore, a sage says, "I will do nothing and the people <br>
will be transformed by themselves. <br>
This means that guarding nature will ensure the flowing and <br>
circulation of the Primordial Breath. <br>
"I will deal in no business and the people become rich by <br>
themselves. <br>
This means that when a person does not deal in business, his <br>
form, breath, vitality, blood, and channels will naturally be <br>
full. <br>
"When I like quietude, the people will be proper and <br>
correct by themselves. <br>
This means that when a person is humble without any evil <br>
thought, the breath will stay in his body. <br>
"When I have no desires, the people will naturally be <br>
simple and honest". <br>
This means that when a person has no lust or desire and holds <br>
firmly the One, then his vitality will be pure and strong <br>
because it has not been weakened and wasted. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good become evil again. <br>
This means that having attained the blessings of the way <br>
(TAO), if a man cannot hold the One, usually he would be <br>
arrogant and evil thoughts will reappear. <br>
The delusions of the people have subsisted for a long time. <br>
This means that the worldly people cannot hold the One. <br>
They are deceived by what is evil and false. They lose <br>
blessings and incur calamities. It has been this way for a very <br>
long time. It is not something that is just happening now. <br>
Therefore, a sage is square but not sharply edged, <br>
"Square" means the correct and the proper way of the One. <br>
You should hold it and practice it firmly. You should promise <br>
yourself not to be harmed again by self-imposed evil. <br>
Sharp and clean but not cutting, <br>
"Sharp and clean" indicates the purity of the breath. One <br>
should not harm the practice of the way (TAO) with dirtiness <br>
and turbidity. <br>
Straight but not reckless, <br>
This means that the merit of the One is smooth yet it yields <br>
and bends with the mind. It does not have the criterion of <br>
straightness as a carpenter 's inked lines. <br>
Bright but not dazzling. <br>
"Bright" indicates that the spirits are bright and they flow <br>
freely to moisten the inside of the body. You do not need to <br>
light up a candle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early serving is the repeated accumulation of the attributes <br>
(TE) of the way (TAO). <br>
This means that the reason why all the evil goes to hide is <br>
because of the accumulated breath from the repeated practice <br>
of the One. <br>
Because of the repeated accumulation of the attributes <br>
(TE), there is nothing that cannot be overcome. <br>
This means that when the One is practiced repeatedly and <br>
breath is accumulated, evil will be expelled and illnesses will <br>
be cured. Therefore there is nothing that cannot be overcome. <br>
When nothing cannot be overcome, one does not know <br>
what is its limit. <br>
This means that when the One circulates in the body, it expels <br>
what is evil and cures diseases. What is its limit is unknown. <br>
Therefore, one will have a long life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not that the evil spirits have lost their magical powers. <br>
It is that their magical power does not harm the people. <br>
It does not mean that the evil spirits have no magical powers. <br>
It is because the way (TAO) resides in people's bodies, <br>
therefore, the evil powers cannot harm the people. <br>
Not only their magical power does not harm the people, a <br>
ruling sage also does not harm the people. <br>
This means that when a person practices the way (TAO), he is <br>
identical to a divinity. Internally, he has no hidden faults. <br>
Therefore, the evil spirits cannot do harm to him. Externally, <br>
he has no open crimes. Therefore, the ruling sages cannot <br>
punish him. When a person practices the One, the heavenly <br>
spirits protect his body externally and take care of his form <br>
internally. His primordial breath is massive only because of <br>
his practices of nourishing his own body. He follows the heaven above. On his head, he wears the illuminating sun and <br>
moon. All the stars and constellations are inside him. <br>
Through his breathing, he has vitality and he dines on the jade <br>
flower (YU YING.) </p>

<p>A big nation is like a downflowing region. It is the <br>
crossroads point of the world. <br>
The mudball (NI WAN) is the big nation. The mouth is the <br>
small nation. The mouth receives from above and irrigates the <br>
elixir field (TAN T' lEN) below. The elixir field is the open <br>
land. <br>
Through being subservient, a small nation gathers from a <br>
big nation. <br>
This means that the mudball (NI WAN) resides above. It is <br>
the big nation. The elixir field (TAN T' lEN) is down below. <br>
It is the small nation. The way to practice the One is to block <br>
off the breath and swallow the saliva to have it flow down to <br>
the elixir field. The saliva is transformed into blood. The <br>
blood is transformed into semen or life force which in turn is <br>
transformed into breath. Then the Embryonic Breathing will <br>
guide it to restore and strengthen the brain. It is pushed and <br>
guided to spread widely to cover the four seas (everywhere). <br>
Therefore, the upper part takes and the lower part gathers. <br>
The small nation abases itself and is content with its lot to be <br>
gentle. It nestles in the big nation and admires and envies the <br>
latter's charm and chivalry. <br>
Both get what they desire. Therefore, a big nation must <br>
place itself low. <br>
"Both" indicates the mudball (NI WAN) and the elixir field <br>
(TAN T'IEN). The rnudball wants the breath to ascend and <br>
the elixir field wants the breath to descend. They achieve the <br>
one spirit together. </p>

<p>Practice non-action. <br>
This means that, he who practices the One does not do it <br>
consciously for the body. <br>
Serve no affairs. <br>
This means that, he who serves the One does not serve <br>
(outside) people. <br>
He who promises lightly will inspire little confidence. <br>
This means that, he who promises lightly will lose the <br>
sincerity of his self-respect. <br>
He who knows these two principles also finds in them his <br>
model and rule. <br>
This means that, when one abandons knowledge and guards <br>
simplicity, illnesses will be expelled and the breath will <br>
prosper. This is the model and rule by which to treat the <br>
body. <br>
It is opposite to things. <br>
This means that the profundity of the One lies in the <br>
descending of the supreme clarity (T' AI CH 'lNG) to the <br>
scarlet palace (CHIANG-KUNG). In all the forms, all things <br>
wither and die. Only you have long life. Therefore, it is the <br>
opposite to the principle of passing away and of <br>
transformation. </p>

<p>The three entail not to venture to be the first in the world. <br>
This means that, one should appreciate and store the life force, <br>
breath and spirit in the body so that one can prolong life. </p>

<p>An able fighter does not lose his temper. <br>
This means that, when a person closes his mouth and <br>
harmonizes his life force, the thousands of spirits will be <br>
delighted. <br>
A great conqueror does not fight. <br>
This means that when a person practices the One with his <br>
mouth , thousands of evil spirits will surrender by themselves. <br>
It therefore says, "does not fight". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I dare not be the host. I would rather be the guest. <br>
The weapon above is the mouth; the weapon below is the sex <br>
organ. When the mouth speaks recklessly, one will bring <br>
harm to oneself. Therefore, one should be humble with <br>
words. When one uses the genitals recklessly, the semen will <br>
be lost. Therefore, one dare not be a leading singer but a <br>
follower , in harmony. <br>
Bare no arms. <br>
Baring the arms is to show rage. An able fighter does not lose <br>
his temper. Therefore , it is as if there were no arms to bare. <br>
There is no catastrophe greater than underestimating the <br>
enemy. <br>
This means that he who indulges himself in intercourse will <br>
have the calamity of dying. <br>
Underestimating the enemy is almost as bad as losing one's <br>
treasure. <br>
"Treasure" indicates the vitality (sperm). When one <br>
underestimates the enemy and fights often, one will lose the <br>
vital spirit. </p>

<p>Therefore, a sage wears coarse clothes while carrying jade <br>
in his bosom. <br>
This means that a sage values the attributes (TE) of the way <br>
TAO) and scorns forms. He wears the hide with hair, yet he <br>
embraces the One and the Primordial. He does not covet high <br>
positions . Internally, he nurtures a bright spirit. He regards <br>
the semen or life force as the jade and the breath as the gold. <br>
Wherefore, he can be transformed and ascend to the purple <br>
palace (TZU-KUNG.) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He who does not know but pretends to know is sick. <br>
This refers to people who do not understand the way (TAO). <br>
They only understand worldly business. They do not know to <br>
ingest breath, but (know) to eat delicacies. Therefore, they <br>
are sick. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not cramp your dwelling place. <br>
This means that one should not dwell in a narrow worldly <br>
place. The high mountains and the wide swamps are good <br>
places for cultivating the inborn nature. <br>
Do not dislike what life depends upon. <br>
This means that he who dislikes life, dies. Therefore, he <br>
should practice the One. He should cherish the breath and <br>
carefully protect the semen. They are the treasures of life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He who is eager in daring will be killed. <br>
This means that if a person is given to sexual pleasures, he <br>
goes alive but returns dead. This is called "eager". If a <br>
person despises the way (TAO) and scorns the spirits, he brings death upon himself. This is called "daring." Both <br>
mean suicide. <br>
Therefore, even a sage regards it as difficult. <br>
This means that nature detests eagerness in daring. It <br>
cherishes timidity and feebleness. He who knows to embrace <br>
life and to cherish breath knows the will of nature. <br>
The way (TAO) of heaven is most able to conquer without <br>
strife. <br>
This means that the way (TAO) of heaven cherishes harmony. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why threaten them with death? <br>
This means that people do not seek longevity . They only seek <br>
pleasure and lust. When they hear of good, they do not <br>
cultivate it. They know evil , yet will not change. What <br>
benefit is their knowing? <br>
An executioner is always set. to execute. <br>
This implies the mouth. On the left side of the mouth is (the <br>
Spirit named) Ssu Yin, the director of the secret. On the right <br>
side of the mouth is (the Spirit named) Ssu-Sha, the <br>
executioner. When a person has secret faults, Ssu Yin reports <br>
them to heaven to investigate his superior and inferior souls. <br>
When a person has bad and evil words, the executioner will <br>
report them to (the Spirit called) Ssu Ming, the arbiter of <br>
destiny . The arbiter will record them. When there are <br>
enough transgressions, then the person will be executed. <br>
To take the place of the executioner so as to kill is like <br>
hewing for a master carpenter. <br>
This means that the heavenly way (TAO) rewards good and <br>
punishes evil. In nourishing a person's body, it is like a <br>
master carpenter's working on his craft . The good will <br>
succeed, the bad will fail. <br>
Those who take the place of the master carpenter seldom <br>
do not have their hands injured. <br>
This implies that when people nourish their body, everyone is <br>
different in his own capacity of being good or bad. It is like <br>
the different degrees of skillfulness of individual craftsmen. <br>
The skillful will succeed in making their work. The unskilled <br>
seldom do not injure themselves. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The people suffer from hunger because their ruler taxes <br>
too much in grain. <br>
"Hunger" indicates the insufficiency of breath. The <br>
insufficiency is caused by the mouth's leisurely addiction to <br>
delicacies (made out of grains). Much ingestion is <br>
called solidifying. Accumulation is for seclusion. Therefore, <br>
hundreds of (evil) matters are prevented. <br>
Therefore, it is difficult to rule. <br>
The people (with their) hundreds of surnames, indicate the <br>
hundreds of (body) channels. The reason why they are <br>
increasing and decreasing and not peaceful is because the <br>
mouth does not hold the One. Then the lips are dry and the <br>
saliva is exhausted. Therefore, the channels are lost and the <br>
life force leaks out. <br>
People underestimate death because they seek to make a <br>
rich living. <br>
This means that the reason why people neglect their death is <br>
because they want to nurture their forms richly so they indulge <br>
in eating. Thus, they lose the way to life. Therefore, they <br>
die. <br>
Only those who do not stress on life are able to exalt life. <br>
This means that if people are able to care about life when life <br>
has not yet been produced, and care about form when the form <br>
has not yet been shaped, and if people are able to think about non-action and dwell on nature only, they are the ones to exalt <br>
the way (TAO) and a peaceful life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, when the weaponry is strong, it will not be <br>
victorious. <br>
"Weaponry" is the mouth. When the mouth is sharp and <br>
strong, a person will be exhausted by others. When the sex <br>
organ is strong, males are harmed by females. <br>
The strong and the big dwell below and the flexible and <br>
weak dwell above. <br>
This implies that the hair, flexible and weak, is worn on the <br>
head by man. The body and the bones, firm and strong are <br>
made in man to labor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is nothing in the world weaker and more flexible <br>
than water, yet none is superior to it in overcoming what is <br>
hard. <br>
"Water" internally is the saliva in the mouth. When rinsed <br>
and swallowed, it can attack evil and destroy what is wicked. <br>
When it penetrates to the bones and marrow, it acts like <br>
fermenting yeast destroying rice. None of any (medical) <br>
prescriptions would be able to take precedence over it. <br>
No one can practice it. <br>
This means that the people, by holding the life force and <br>
swallowing (sometimes) the breath, do govern the blood and <br>
the hundreds of channels. (So) they use this method daily <br>
without knowing of it. <br>
He who can accept a nation's dirtiness (should be) the <br>
ruler of the gods of the soil and the grains. <br>
This means that in a man's (bodily) form, the left soul is the <br>
god of the earth and the right soul is the god of the grains. (A <br>
man) should manage the One Breath (which is their ruler) in <br>
order to be a ruler. <br>
He who can accept a nation's misfortune is the king of the <br>
world. <br>
"Nation" is the (bodily) form. This indicates that the One <br>
comes and goes in the spleen to transform the sediment and <br>
the liquid and to remove the old and to receive the new in <br>
order to nourish the five spirits (of the five viscera) <br>
Therefore , it is the king of the viscera and the receptacles. <br>
Right words seem to mean the opposite. <br>
This indicates that common people want to respect what is <br>
fresh and clean. They value what is fragrant and beautiful, yet <br>
the way (TAO) makes the person who accepts what is dirty as <br>
the ruler and makes the person who deals with what is inferior <br>
as the king. This means that the One is the opposite of what <br>
common people (think). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How can this be regarded as good? <br>
This implies the mouth. This means that when there is a <br>
leading singer, others will join in. When a person is able to <br>
practice the way (TAO), the way will come and answer him. <br>
When the leading singer sings about good, good ensues. Then <br>
there will be no more grievances. Nowadays, people like to <br>
practice evil thoughts. Therefore, evil thoughts follow. They <br>
summon evil spirits which hence respond. When a leading <br>
singer sings of evil, evil ensues. How can this be good? <br>
Therefore, a sage holds the left tally and does not demand <br>
from others. <br>
"The left tally" is referring to the virtues of the Yang (force). <br>
This means that a sage does not settle (external) great <br>
grievances and leaves behind evoked grudges. He cultivates the attributes (TE) of the way (TAO) by himself and does not <br>
make demands upon others . <br>
He who has the attributes (TE) of the way (TAO) takes <br>
charge of the tallies, while he who does not have the <br>
attributes (TE) of the way (TAO) takes charge of exaction. <br>
This means that when a person practices the attributes of the <br>
way (TAO), the arbiter of destiny (Ssu-Ming) will bestow a <br>
longer life on him. When a person practices evil, the <br>
executioner (Ssu-Sha) will confiscate what he has. This is <br>
what it means. </p>

<p>It is ideal to have a small nation with a small population. <br>
Even if there are tens and hundreds of tools, they belong <br>
to the people, and they should not be worn out. <br>
"A small nation" implies the body. "Tens and hundreds" <br>
implies the five viscera. The heart and the kidneys are the <br>
"tens" and the liver and the lungs are the "hundreds". When a <br>
person closes the mouth and circulates the breath, tens and <br>
hundreds of breaths are profuse. None is not in use. <br>
Let the people return to the use of tying ropes. <br>
This means that when a person has the way (TAO), his breath <br>
will naturally flow and circulate for the use of the body, just <br>
like the tokens of knotted rope. <br>
Savor the food and enjoy the beautiful clothing . <br>
This irnplies that a person will find relish in ingesting breath <br>
and enjoying the way (TAO) as (his) beautiful clothing. <br>
Be happy in the culture. <br>
This means that a person is happy with the body and the spirit. <br>
He embraces (his) abdomen and it sings. Though the neighboring nations are within sight and the <br>
dog's barkings and the rooster's crowings within earshot, <br>
the people will never exchange visits up to their old age. <br>
"The neighboring nations" are the two ears. The two ears are <br>
within sight of each other in order to guard peace. They make <br>
the spirit and the breath guard their own places. They do not <br>
visit or bother each other. Therefore, a person is able to keep <br>
his hearing clear up to his old age. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Honest words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not <br>
honest. <br>
This means that he who believes in the words of the way <br>
(TAO) does not extol worldly affairs. He who extols worldly <br>
affairs will not believe in the words of the way (TAO). </p>
