<p>DO NOT be alarmed when the narrator starts off with saying it's part 4, section 1, without naming "the Sandman". The narrator did NOT mention the title but it's "the Sandman." It was published as a part of "Weird Tales" (Hence "part 4, section 1 of Weird Tales" narration.)  and the BEST one among them.
“The unrivalled master of the uncanny in literature”, said Sigmund Freud praising E. T. A. Hoffmann. Hoffmann is considered as one of the best horror/gothic writers from Germany by many fans and now listen for yourself and be the judge on his uncanny world.
This one is atmospheric horror that starts slowly and eventually marches into suffocating atmosphere of madness.
People who enjoy atmospheric horror such as the works of H. P. Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Edgar Allan Poe,  etc. might enjoy this story greatly.
