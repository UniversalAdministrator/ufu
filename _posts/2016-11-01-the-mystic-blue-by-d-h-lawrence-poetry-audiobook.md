  The Mystic Blue (by D. H. Lawrence)

post_excerpt: |
  OUT of the darkness, fretted sometimes in its sleeping,
  Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
  To sight, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.
  Sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel
  Runs into speed like a dream, the blue of the steel
  Showing the rocking darkness now a-reel.
  And out of the invisible, streams of bright blue drops
  Rain from the showery heavens, and bright blue
  crops
  Surge from the under-dark to their ladder-tops.
  And all the manifold blue and joyous eyes,
  The rainbow arching over in the skies,
  New sparks of wonder opening in surprise.
  All these pure things come foam and spray of the sea
  Of Darkness abundant, which shaken mysteriously,
  Breaks into dazzle of living, as dolphins that leap
  from the sea
  Of midnight shake it to fire, so the secret of death
  we see.

<p>OUT of the darkness, fretted sometimes in its sleeping,
Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
To sight, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.
Sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel
Runs into speed like a dream, the blue of the steel
Showing the rocking darkness now a-reel.
And out of the invisible, streams of bright blue drops
Rain from the showery heavens, and bright blue
    crops
Surge from the under-dark to their ladder-tops.
And all the manifold blue and joyous eyes,
The rainbow arching over in the skies,
New sparks of wonder opening in surprise.
All these pure things come foam and spray of the sea
Of Darkness abundant, which shaken mysteriously,
Breaks into dazzle of living, as dolphins that leap
    from the sea
Of midnight shake it to fire, so the secret of death
    we see.
